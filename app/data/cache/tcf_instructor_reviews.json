Her teaching is fine, most of the issues from the class come from departamental decisions. Most of your grade comes from quizzes, a final project, and a final exam, and the quizzes and final exam are intentionally difficult and meant to trick you. While you can study, a lot of your success comes down to being able to fundamentally understand code (all quizzes/exam are on paper), which wasn't as easy for me. I did a lot better with the take home assignments (PAs and the final project) because I had a lot more time to mess with the code. The class itself is in python, so if you are already familiar (which I was), actually learning is relatively easy. I imagine it's okay for people with no experience with python, the learning curve isn't that bad. - they'll teach you everything you need to know.\nTLDR; Khargonkar is a good professor, the class structure itself (which she doesn't make) isn't good. #tCFF23"

In addition to that, the professor provides zero leniency on just about anything related to this class. Nothing against her personally, but she is a pretty awful lecturer and professor.

There are weekly quizzes, programming assignments, labs, and readings, but I never did the readings and did just fine. There are only two exams throughout the semester. The professors were super lenient about missing exams (the final exam grade would be used) and quizzes/labs (some of them would be dropped. The PAs were not difficult until the end, but I would definitely recommend going to office hours. In my opinion, the exams were not too difficult, but other people in the class really struggled with them. The questions include things that are not gone in over in detail in class, but they are definitely mentioned. The exams tended to focus more on the details of the methods and functions used, and only a few questions about the overall structure/usage of them. I would recommend going to class and actually paying attention. A key thing that helped in my studying was just checking what random modifications would do to how the code functions, and really understanding what can be tested in the code."

CS is a very important skill to learn and I'm glad I took it for the experience, but this is the first and last cs class I'm ever taking.

Definitely start early on the PA homework assignments so that you have time to get help in office hours, which I also highly suggest going to.  I took this course online during the summer, so he switched up how testing works compared to his in-person classes.  Our 'tests' were verbal 'walkthroughs,' where you talk out the logic behind some of your PAs & the TA asks you some questions.  Pretty chill and much easier than his normal in-person paper/pencil exams.  Most people get an A or A- as long as stuff is turned in on time."

I don't know anyone who watched the recorded asynchronous lectures by Dill.  The final project wasn't hard and exams were stretched for time but not too difficult. My main complaint about this course is office hours. You would have to wait up to an hour to speak to a TA in office hours, and they often wouldn't know how to help you if you had a problem that wasn't standard. Additionally, Labs were so bad.   It is hard to code with a partner and we were required to have a partner during lab. It made learning  much more difficult and not  enjoyable.

He explains the core concepts very well and I went from knowing virtually nothing about coding to creating a whole video game by the end of the semester. He also has a certain charm that makes lectures pretty enjoyable, even though you don't really need to go as he posts the recordings online. While some of the exams were somewhat difficult, as long as you do the PA's, you should be able to get an A in the class. They also give you extra credit if you submit the PA 48 hours before it is due (they post it a week before its due), which is a bonus.The one thing I will say is that the labs were very awkward. Most of the work is done in partners, which ends up usually with one person doing all the work and the other being completely lost as there's not a very concise way to have two people work on the same code together. They felt like the labs were always either super helpful or a waste of time."

There are weekly programming assignments that range from do-in-your-sleep easy to tear-your-hair-out complex.  The exams were notably difficult as you have to program on paper, so there's no trial and error that using an IDE would allow you to. Labs were probably the worst part of the class. They were graded on attendance, but the actual programming you had to do was unnecessarily difficult and awkward as you have to do it with another partner.

The exams (2 midterms and a final) are terribly designed and terribly written. You have to handwrite code and evaluate code that in no way judges your own programming capability. So, study the nitty-gritty things like value types, the nuances of loops, and other fundamentals of Python before the exam. Regardless of how well you think you understand Python, your ability to do the assignments or the labs is NOT an indicator of your success on the exams.2. Do not prioritize a professor or a time slot; all the recordings are posted online! You can watch them anytime in high quality and at 1.5x speed. Professor Pettit's recordings are particularly stellar.3. I should not have to say this, but do not share code or collaborate with others on assignments. It is not from my own personal experience, but from hearing the stories of others who were caught. Each person's program is unique in style and format. So, it is very easy to spot unusual similarities. It is never worth it to cheat, especially at UVA with the honor code. Please, please, please do your own honest work because many of those who did not were caught."

I had no coding experience whatsoever not even a CS major/minor, but ended with a 98 in the class, this class made me love coding but this is still a very difficult class with LOTS of work. Lectures are mostly live-coding - recorded for AS students but u can attend OS which I did (big tip is code with them on python for your class notes). The weekly PAs are crucial for ur grade - try to get 100s on all of them and GO TO OFFICE HOURS FOR HELP ON THEM. Can't stress this enough. But sometimes the waiting room for OH will be a 2 hour wait - not bad because you just get in line on ur computer and wait and do other stuff. U cannot get behind on work in the class, but I think it's a super beneficial class and if u do the work like I did with zero coding experience you can get an A. Not easy A but this class isnt like insanely hard, just do ur work. Both professors care about their students & are pretty flexible if need be, McBurney loves his cats and makes bald jokes alot so play along he loves it. Tip: during class ask to see his catcam. Will miss this class but also not miss the huge workload that comes with it  (also do not cheat, they will 100% find out because everyones codes are so unique and give u a C, just take the L on that assignment or that part of the PA and move on, not worth it) #tCF2020"

This class involves a lot of self-teaching and trial and error, but it feels extremely rewarding when you complete programs correctly. My one complaint with the class was the method in which office hours were conducted, it was extremely cutthroat as students competed to get time with the TA's. DO NOT EXPECT THE TA's TO DO YOUR CODE FOR YOU. The grading was split between labs, programming assignments, quizzes, and code walkthroughs (time where a TA would review a code with you and ask questions). The programming assignments became harder and harder as the semester continued, but it also became more and more satisfying.

I enrolled in the class under McBurney but ended up watching Pettit's recorded lectures online most of the time- I thought his lectures were slightly easier to follow although they were both pretty good.

They offer practice exams from previous semesters before exams, which is excellent. The exams are especially difficult compared to the assignments in this course, so definitely practice beforehand. Learning programming is similar to math: you have to practice it to develop a fundamental understanding. The textbook is free for this class, although I didn't find myself using it much at all. Everything that was needed was provided from the lectures. Also, if you are a gamer or interested in gaming development: the final project was to create our own minigame, and it was a ton of fun.

I read the recommended reading for the first like three classes, but after that I stopped.  Professor McBurney made the content very easy to understand, though he used other professors' PowerPoints so any of the professors might make this class easy too.  Having your laptop right there in class to see exactly how the code works definitely helps.\nThe homework was relatively easy.  I finished almost every single one more than 48 hours before it was due to get that extra credit that was offered.  It's a great grade booster and helped immensely when it came to balancing out my final grade.\nYou certainly need that homework boost though because the one catch of the class are the three paper exams.  It's a total wrench in the entire course because you think you're doing so well and then the exam happens and then that's not the case.  Though most of my own mistakes were just small mistakes when I knew I really knew the answer, that's just me though.\nTo keep it short this class was great.

(So if you want to take a class with her that doesn’t involve python she’ll probably be a great instructor). This is also her first semester at UVA so I think she’s still adjusting.\nGrade breakdown: Programming assignments (PAs) are 35% (weekly assignments, open note, drop lowest score), labs are 10% (graded on effort, drop lowest), quizzes are 10% (timed, weekly, open note, drop lowest 2), final project is 10% (create a game with a partner), exams are 35% (timed, closed note, exam 1 and 2 are each 10%, final exam is 35%). I did terribly on the exams and the main thing that saved me (and got me a B+ as my final grade) was that most assignments were open note. A lot of other people thought the exams were hard and the mean and median exam grades were around B-/C+, so I highly encourage you to practice with the previous exams that are uploaded to Collab.\nThe Piazza discussion board was helpful for asking questions. The other professors recorded their lectures so eventually I stopped going to class in person and just watched the recordings and read the powerpoint slides.\nThis is my least favorite class I’ve ever taken at UVA. I was confused most of the time and I feel like I didn’t learn anything (I’m not sure how much of that is Morrison’s fault and how much is just me having no interest in python). I would have dropped this class if I didn’t need it for my major. I went to the TAs for homework help a few times, and while they were always nice and supportive, they usually gave me wrong answers so I stopped going to office hours.\nWith all that being said, if you think you might be interested in programming, sign up for this class! Everyone I’ve talked to who has taken this class in the past loved it, and I only met one other person who disliked the class. Plus, this is an e-school class so you have at least a month to decide on if you want to drop the class (versus arts and sciences where you have 2 weeks to decide). This class is also designed for people with no coding experience, so don’t worry if you’ve never coded before (I actually have prior coding experience but the languages I learned are very different from python so it didn’t help me. So any prior coding experience you have probably won’t help you unless it is with python.) Python is also one of the easiest languages to learn.\ntl;dr Morrison is kind and supportive, but you’d probably be better off with one of the other professors. This class is manageable if you put in the work."

I thought Luther made this course a lot more interesting and fun than I initially thought it would be. I personally liked Luther more than what I saw from Sheriff when he guest-lectured one time. Luther seems to really care about students and is always willing to answer questions, during lecture or after. He posts his lectures and notes on his website, making it easily accessible if you need a refresher or if you skipped class/zoned out like I did. The whole course was super organized, which I really liked. The course is basically made up of almost-weekly homework, two tests, one final, some online quizzes, and a lab grade. If you pay attention and try, you will be able to master the concepts and get a good grade. There are office hours available almost every day where you can go to the super knowledgeable TAs to get help. I only went to office hours at the end of the semester, but I found using piazza to get a quick answer to a question was super useful. The homework start out pretty easy, although they are a bit time-consuming, and really get you to learn CS through doing it. However, beware there is a jump in difficulty right before the first partner homework. Overall, I recommend this course to anyone who's interested! It can be pretty easy if you actually try and you will definitely learn a lot!"

If you have the option to take CS with Aidan, take it with him!!!Now for the actual class, it sucks. The stuff you learn in lecture is so simple, and you will always leave lecture thinking you understand. Then you get the weekly programming assignments, and realize you don't get it because they took the concepts and escalated them so much. The Pa's take a long time so start early. Also the exams are so stupid. The first one is fine, but the second one no matter how much you study you will not do good. They are written exams which test you on all the little tiny things about python. Coding is very much trial and error, and you need to try different ways to problem solve the problem before you get it right. Making the exams written take away all of that, so you would think the exams wouldn't test you on all the weird tiny things about python, but no that is exactly what they are. This semester the class average was like a 50% on the second exam, and if that is the average on your exam especially in an intro CS class there is clearly a problem with the exam, not the students.#tCFspring2022"

Overall, just a really great guy and therefore I felt the need to write this review.\nAs for the course itself, there are three 50 min lectures a week M/W/F, a weekly programming assignment, and weekly quizzes. Once the semester gets started you will become more familiar with these assignments, but for now, just remember that 2 of your lowest quiz scores will be dropped and your lowest programming assignment will also be dropped at the end of the year.

I had some very minimal experience with coding in the past in C and found the adjustment to Python was negligible. He was very willing to answer questions during class and to go more in depth on a topic if needed. The weekly programming assignments were not too bad after the initial learning curve that outputs had to exactly match the prompt in order to get credit. The quizzes felt redundant and not like an actual measure of knowledge on the topic and nitpicked minor intricacies of the language that in any actual coding environment a coder could just look up the documentation to understand an error. However they were doable with some studying. We were also able to retake our lowest quiz grade. Overall would recommend for everyone to take at some point in college. #tCFF23"

I would highly recommend doing the PA's early, just in case they take longer than you expect.  Being able to sleep on my code actually led to me waking up with a new algorithm idea that ended up being functionally correct.  The game project is as hard as you make it, so choosing a partner who will pull their own weight (this requires them being on the same level as you so that they understand your code) is crucial.  Again, getting ahead on the game project so you can focus on your other finals is also crucial.  The tests were very similar to the practice tests (take and retake these--they are very helpful).

He's dynamic and engaging and wants people to participate even if the class is 300 students strong. He posts all of his lectures on Panopto so you can watch them again (or for the first time if you skipped). Most importantly, he actually seems interested in teaching, which is a pretty low bar to set but it is definitely one that needs to be cleared. Anyway, all CS 1110 classes have the same assignments which range in difficulty and are submitted online, plus the website you submit them on will give you automated feedback about whether or not your code passed all tests or not. There's an hour and fifteen minute lab every week which normally does not go the full time (make sure you pick a good lab partner though). There are three exams and a final project none of which are overly difficult.

To start off, Brunelle is a great professor: he's engaging and explains concepts very well. The lab portion (9% of your grade) and final project (10%) are basically completion grades, so it's easy to get at least 20% of your grade to be a nice 100. There are 21 homework assignments (each 2%) due about every week in the course; while the first 10-15 are pretty easy, the last 5 are pretty difficult (pa 17 is where it definitely starts getting tough). However, if you submit early you receive feedback which is very helpful. I never went to office hours, simply because I never felt I had to. The nice thing about this course is that if you actually figure out the homeworks on your own, the tests are pretty straight forward. The first midterm had an average of an 88, but the second one had an average of a 73 (a testament to the steep drop off in difficulty following exam 1). However, for each exam there are 4-6 released practice tests which mirror the exam pretty well-- these are by far and away the best tools to use. The final exam definity covers more material from the second half of the course (more complex material), but again, practice exams are your best friend. I came out of this course with an A and am planning to minor in CS. If you are looking for an interesting elective, a useful skill, or a possible major/ minor I highly recommend this course (especially with Brunelle but I've heard great things about other professors). One last piece of advise: it's pretty easy and can be tempting to group work the homework (or straight up copy) but this will screw you over for exams, so I don't recommend."

All lectures are uploaded online from 2 different sections (Brunelle and Tychonievich, doesn't matter which one you watch b/c they both talk about the same stuff, except Brunelle uses PPTs), and there are review videos for all of the exams by one of the TAs (Sean Gatewood, look him up on youtube, they were super helpful), and the professors and TAs are very approachable/funny.

Not only that, but she is an extremely kind person who truly cares for each student's success. She encourages questions during class, and she always reminds us that she is open during office hours for questions and chats not just about the class, but also for mentoring and research. I would highly recommend that if you don't have any prior CS experience to take this course with Basit. Really, if you have the opportunity to take any course at all with her, you should do so. She is one of the best professors I have had here.Now about the course itself. It meets three times a week for an hour and fifteen minutes each, which seems like a lot, but each class is an integrated lecture and lab, so all in all it meets for the same time as the other intro CS classes. Each class, Basit would usually lecture for about an hour on a new topic, and then the last 10-15 minutes would be an in class activity/\"lab\". These were graded on effort and completion, so you didn't necessarily need to finish them or get them right to get credit, which was nice because some classes I felt like we weren't given enough time for them. Each week, there was usually a programming assignment (PA) and a take-home quiz to do over the weekend. Overall, the PAs weren't too but some of them were a little challenging and time-consuming. You can go to TA office hours for help on these, but I never had very good experiences in office hours. Often I would wait 30-45 minutes for the TA to find me, and then they couldn't figure out my issue and they'd just tell me to post my question to Piazza. The take-home quizzes were also not bad, as they are open-note and open-IDE. Your two lowest quiz grades get dropped at the end of the semester, which is really nice. The class also had two midterms, which were difficult, but they're not worth that much of your grade compared to other classes. Basit also let us do exam corrections for up to ten points which was so nice. There is also no final exam, just a final project that is only worth 5% of your grade. If you stay on top of everything in this class, I would say it is pretty easy to get an A.\n#tCFF23"

The homework assignments and lecture quizzes are also pretty straightforward and don't take that much time to complete.\nInstead of a final exam, there is a final project that is done in groups. In my opinion, this project wasn't super time-consuming but the TAs are always super friendly and helpful.\nAll in all a pretty chill class to take if you need a CS credit.

I've never programmed in my life, and I didn't know what to expect from this course. I had worries that this course might be super difficult or the material would be impossible to understand and fully comprehend, but those worries soon became excitement for what I would learn next and how I could apply everything from if-statements and while loops to my life and how they make things a lot easier. I was also worried about how my instructor would be in terms of personality, as I don't particularly get along with professors that radiate negative vibes. Elizabeth's personality was completely different from that, she was akin to a ray of sunshine and I appreciated that. She encouraged frequent class participation, and even gave out rubber ducks to students who asked or answered questions in class (as an incentive to encourage class participation). I really enjoyed the image manipulation and the clever usage of dictionaries, and I found all of the material to be presented in a manner that was very intuitive and easy to understand. It was her first time teaching the course, but I honestly wouldn't have been surprised if she told us at the end that it was all a joke and that she had been teaching the course for over a decade. If you ever get the chance to take CS 1112 with Elizabeth, don't hesitate to take it! Additionally, the TAs for this course were more than stellar and were always available to answer any questions if there happened to be misunderstandings, and there was a review session before every test (and the final!) to answer any questions and go over past test questions."

Having Horton as the prof really made this course and I highly recommend it if just for him. Professors like Leung or those  in other huge courses often have a teaching style that goes over the heads of tons of the students, and we have to end up learning everything through homework anyhow. That's not the case with 1113 at all- I felt like I actually learned by showing up the class, which is honestly so refreshing in college. HIGHLY recommended, if if you find out that you don't like CS at all like me, lol! (I still ended up with an A)"

Overall I'd say it's a fairly easy A or B, but if you don't understand the material the resources out there aren't the greatest, especially because it starts in Idris, which is a programming language with very little non-technical (i.e. understandable to intro students) information found online, or even from the TA's sometimes.

            "text": "Do your self a favor and do not take this course with Professor Sullivan. The way he teaches this class is a departure from the cirriculum of the other introductory CS courses.\nInstead of learning python right off the bat, the first 2/3 of the class dealt with the relatively unknown functional programming language called Idris along with learning tools like git and emacs. In theory, learning Idris provides a very solid understanding of the basic programming that will transition well into python and helps to provide a better \"base\" to build your programming knowledge thank learning python right off the bat. Learning about emacs, git, and terminal commands provide techniques to students that they normally might learn later down the line, but Sullivan was keen on students using the tools and are used in the real world even if unnecessary. I enjoyed learning idris and the other tools and it is very likely that I have a better base to build from for future computer science courses.\nThe problems of the class stemmed from the incredibly poor organization and communication, and from the transition from learning Idris to learning python. According to the syllabus each homework assignment would amount to something like 2% of our entire grade and yet basic information like knowing when to do them, where to find them, and if they were even an assignment that would be graded was extremely poorly communicated. Some assignments were posted on piazza, some on collab, others in a github repository, and often different parts were located in separate locations. Despite stating that late submissions were allowed on the syllabus, they were not.\nAlthough there was certainly some carry over from Idris to Python, it was obvious that students were not connecting the dots like he was. A main problem was that portions of the class had major coding experience, as would be expected in a UVA intro CS class, while others had none at all. It was very obvious looking at the python game assignment in which the disparity amongst the student games was staggering. Naturally, Mr. Sullivan assumed that the transition was made easily by his students. Many sections on the final exam came from python material covered briefly on the last day of class as well.\nFall 2015 was the first year that this class was taught and that Professor Sullivan taught it and some hiccups were to be expected, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. However, if your interest was piqued by the description of CS 1113, like mine was, I would urge you to take the standard intro CS class instead."

He really wants you to major in computer science, so he will make sure that you learn everything easily.\nI had no computer science experience in this class, and I think that I'll get an A. At first, you will have trouble learning the syntax and language of coding, but it's a huge learning curve and once you get over that hump you'll be good.\nSullivan emphasizes learning how to functionally program first, so that we can do imperative programming better down the line. What this means is that you actually won't get to do Python until the last week or so. However, I can assure you this is the best approach possible. Python seems like a joke after what we do. If you plan on doing computer science in the future, take this class, it's a great foundation.\nLabs can be stressful sometimes though, I'll admit. However, they are all completion grades, so as long as you show up you get 100s. Same goes for homeworks.\nFirst exam is very tough, but Sullivan lets you drop lowest grade.\nStudying for this class is strange. You shouldn't actually be \"studying\" for exams like you do in 99% of classes. What you need to do is just show up to class and pay attention every day, and you don't need to study one bit. Exams are open-note and are more about application than memorizing a bunch of stuff that you'll forget in a few days. That being said, you can't fall behind. Go to office hours if you have any questions, obviously.\nPretty straightforward to get an A."

First part is about Morrison, second is about the class overall.\nMorrison does her best. I agree with the other reviewer that her \"help\" can feel very dismissive (ex: when the program we were using, Codepost, wasn't working, she refused to take accountability and blamed us all for doing it wrong, despite entirely too many Piazza posts proving otherwise), but she can be helpful at times, and she's definitely much nicer in person. This is her first time teaching the course here, so I'm hoping she'll learn from her mistakes and be better next semester. The way she scheduled the semester was very confusing, with many labs covering content we haven't discussed in lecture, and then our quizzes are on content we haven't talked about in weeks. I'll give more specifics about scheduling below, but I think a big reason we have the scheduling mistakes is because of Morrison's poor planning. I will say, to her credit, she explains the content really well overall in her lectures, and she answers Piazza questions very quickly. My biggest problem is that there are many times I will understand the content but have zero idea how to code it when it comes to the homeworks. For a programming professor, she barely does any programming. If you actually want to learn the coding, you have to go to Stone's lectures in person (he doesn't record the programming parts), but he's terrible at explaining the concepts. I honestly think this class would be great if they taught it together, rather than you having to choose one, but that's not the way it is.\nNow for the class content itself. It is... a mess, to say the least. Morrison heads the course this semester, and since she and Stone haven't taught it before, neither of them know what they're doing. Half the time people ask questions about the homework/quizzes in Stone's lectures, he doesn't know the answers because Morrison created them and he didn't really look at them.\nI mentioned the scheduling before, so I'll go more into it now. You can turn in homeworks early for extra credit—definitely recommend, it's the only reason I'm getting an A in this class—but they're due on Sundays, the only day basically no TAs have office hours. And Morrison rarely checks Piazza posts on Sundays anyway, when she's the only one who responds to anyone on Piazza. The homeworks can take you a ton of time, and they eat up most of my weekends (AVL trees *and* an online quiz on Easter was absolutely brutal IMO). Whatever you do, start early. You'll need it, especially towards the end of the semester. The quizzes (worth 50% of your overall grade, 25% in class quizzes and 25% online quizzes, 5 of each) are every few weeks. Out of town for a quiz? Too bad, make it up for the optional final, which you only have one day to do. For the final, you can make up four quizzes, but in one day, that's not a lot of time per quiz to study and do the quizzes you need. The online ones are really easy, and they're open note—though I've never really needed my notes for them, anyway—but the in person ones are terrible. They never release the quiz averages, which seems a little shady to me, when the ones they have released are ~60% averages with no curve.\nThe TAs may be the worst part of this course. They never answer Piazza questions, office hours are always full, and they take forever to grade anything. We're almost done with the semester with less than half of our grades. I say I'm getting an A, but I have no idea. The last few homeworks and quizzes have become completely auto graded because of them. When I did go to office hours, they weren't helpful. They either Googled the answer in front of me or gave me debugging tips I'd already tried. At this point, I think I'm more of a TA than the actual TAs, considering how many times I've had to help my friends with labs and homeworks because the TAs don't do what they get paid to do.\nThe course content isn't terrible, really. If you pay attention in lecture, study a little before the quizzes, and start your homeworks early, you can manage an A pretty easily. Just don't count on the TAs or professors to help you. I, for one, never plan on taking another class with Morrison or Stone again, and I don't think you should, either."

            "text": "The course covers a lot of ground and moves quite quickly, especially at the beginning. If you're coming from 1110/don't have experience with a C-like object oriented language, I don't think it would hurt to get some basic experience with Java prior to taking the class, since they really blast through teaching the language in the first couple of weeks order to get to the more abstract concepts. I found the data structures and sorts genuinely interesting, and they're particularly applicable to technical interviews/any programming really.\nAs a lecturer/teacher, I found Morrison pretty effective. I eventually found that I learned best when I didn't attend class and instead watched the recordings so I could pause to digest and think through the concepts, since I think she tends to jump from A to B a little quickly at times, but her explanations were sound and my follow-up questions were always addressed with care. She was clearly aware of the complaints about the amount of slides and lack of live coding from last semester since she made a point of cutting down her presentation slides and spending lecture time doing demos (though she basically stopped the demos when we got to the more abstract concepts, but I think that's valid when the homeworks have you doing all the implementation of those concepts anyway).As a person, when she's not one-on-one I would describe her as either sassy or snarky depending on how generous I'm feeling, but when interacting personally in office hours or after class she was really lovely - she was interested in me as a person and was genuinely excited to talk/nerd out about the content. She also was quite receptive to any feedback I had, and I think ran a fairly smooth ship this semester. She's still figuring some stuff out, and having a quiz the week of Thanksgiving was not great, but she went back to Gradescope at least and was able to adjust on the fly when she missed a week (due to illness).\nMost undergrad TAs are uninterested and/or clueless, but a couple are good (shout out to Nathaniel the Piazza goat and Jacob). I only went to office hours a couple times and there was always 10+ people in the queue since there's only usually 2 TAs on one shift, so I wouldn't rely on TA office hours too heavily if you can help it. The graduate TAs were also up and down throughout the semester in terms of turnaround time for grading, but it wasn't too awful. I think the worst it got was 4 weeks to grade one of the homeworks.\nThe grading breakdown this semester was 36% for 12 homeworks, 13% for 9 labs, 12.5% for 5 quiz As (at home, mostly open note), 37.5% for 5 quiz Bs (in-person, closed book) and 1% for a syllabus quiz. No curve, but homeworks can be turned in 2 days early for 0.3% extra credit (which adds up to 3.6% over the semester), plus another 1% for course evals, so you can easily bump your grade from an A- to an A through that. Quiz Bs were the hardest to do well in, everything else was chill if I stayed on top of it all, but I found most questions on quiz Bs manageable if I studied the slides closely and practiced applying concepts (a few questions tested completely useless or tangential knowledge though).\nThis wasn't communicated clearly, but I got the impression that we were expected to be putting effort into learning on our own time (through tinkering with code and/or reviewing other resources) in order to really succeed. I think it's a valid approach to teaching, particularly for computer science/programming where the real world expects you to learn on the fly with varying quality of documentation as your only resource, but whether that works for you is your call - my advice would be to try embrace it regardless."

While some of the syntax is different, most of the concepts remain the same, so it will give you a good opportunity to figure out what you need to do to adapt to Morrison's improved but admittedly fast and somewhat surface-level teaching. Because of this, make it a habit to ask questions in lectures and attend office hours often. In labs, find a good TA or experienced student to ask questions. Complex data structures like AVL Trees, Priority Queues, and HashMaps can cause you to slip up near the end, but because the final was just an opportunity to retake 4 of the 10 quizzes, you definitely have opportunities to catch up. It's still an intro course relative to the rest of the CS department's offerings, but it's definitely easier than classes like CS 2130."

There's 1 lab and 1 HW due per week, and a quiz every 2-3 weeks. The quiz component consists of a multi-choice test and a coding test.

I think learning code via lectures isn't very helpful (regardless of the prof), so I don't know if another prof could've done better with the material.

Also, someone who does not have experience in Java may struggle to adapt, especially if they are coming straight from the Python class.I did pretty well on the quizzes, but from my experience sometimes it can be luck because the questions are random for each student. Sometimes, the quiz would be pretty straightforward, but other times, I would have multiple tricky questions where I was stuck between two answers.But outside of the quizzes, there's so much extra credit, and you should do it. It gives you so much leeway to bomb a few quizzes and still get an A. Also, you get two tries for each quiz. Plus, I think I heard that they added extra credit for doing some notes worksheet, but honestly that's overkill."

The quizzes were impossible, the knowledge expected not having been taught, and the questions being rather tangential. You can do perfectly on the homework and labs, but the quizzes will sink you.

Because of these circumstances, many assignments and Gradescope autograders were released pretty late and many timelines were adjusted. This was kind of frustrating, but I don't really foresee this being a problem if you take this in future semesters. The weekly coding homeworks range in difficulty, so you should make sure you start early because a few will require lots of office hours if you're stuck. There are also written analysis homeworks, which can be easy if you have a good cohort of peers to do them with; I highly recommend finding a good group/cohort to work with on these that will be willing to help each other understand the importance/implications of certain modules. Quizzes are not too hard; as long as you study you will do fine.

In multiple cases, deadlines were extended or entire assignments were scrapped at the last minute. I'm hoping they've worked out some of the issues they faced this semester because I think it would have been a more enjoyable experience if deadlines weren't constantly changing.\nSome pros: lectures are recorded so you can look back at any point (and you can watch other professors' lectures), lots of TA office hours (with varying levels of busyness... definitely plan to be there for awhile if you go the day the HW is due or in some cases even the day before), no formal exams (weekly short quizzes that you have a few opportunities to retake)\nYou can do well in this course, but you really have to start assignments early.

For us, all programming assignment grades except for one were completely based on the autograder, which in many cases was not working or unhelpful in figuring out what was wrong. Especially for earlier autograders, error messages were quite generic and gave little insight into which component was actually causing problems. A few times, autograders were so unreliable or broken to the point where deadlines had to be pushed back, which made the course extremely difficult to plan around. Even when we were given the tester programs as part of homework packages, it was pretty difficult to follow how they tested our code and pointed out errors, so they were of limited use and potentially none at all. Because of all of this, I had a pretty unhappy time in the class. I hope the wrinkles in the course get ironed out in future semesters and it is far more organized.

Firstly, Floryan is an outstanding professor (probably one of my favorite) and is a very talented lecturer as he explains difficult concepts in clear and concise manner.\nWith regards to the course structure, I personally felt that this course was designed really well as we were able to gain a solid understanding of some of the most commonly used data structures (arrays, vectors, linked lists (stacks/queues), trees, hash tables, heaps). The coding homework assignments, for the most part, were fair and allowed students to gain a thorough understanding of the inner workings of data structures. This class is definitely a step up in difficulty from the intro-level CS classes; the first three weeks might be slightly intimidating for those who have never seen Java before, but again, Floryan is an amazing professor and really helped us get comfortable using Java.\nOne of the best things in this class is how it operates in a weekly quiz format instead of the traditional midterms/final format. You are tested on one topic at a time, and if you happen to do poorly on a quiz, there are NUMEROUS ways to improve your grade.\nThe purpose of the analysis assignments is to compare how theoretical efficiencies of data structures correlate to experimentally derived data (which I think is a great concept - the bigOH analysis, in particular, was really helpful). My only gripe with this course is how the analysis assignments require too much unnecessary information to be included (intro/methodology, etc.). IMO only the results and conclusion sections are needed to serve the purpose of the analysis.\nOverall, this course was fantastic, and you will learn so many fundamental and crucial topics in computer science."

I would not take this class if you didn't need it for your major, as this is a very time-consuming class, but as a CS major, I found the topics that we learned about interesting because it gives you a better idea of how Java works behind the scenes when you use its built-in data structures."

If you put off coding until the last minute, it will be very stressful, but starting early and taking breaks helped me finish the code without many issues generally. The writing assignments could be somewhat annoying; however, they were generally graded very leniently and helped boost your grade. The class is structured to give weekly quizzes instead of midterms and finals, there are multiple opportunities to retake any given quiz, and a 7/8 is rounded up to an 8/8.

From only communicating on Discord (??) to making the final an oral exam (albeit technically optional), the professors' choices sometimes felt like a prank. The problem sets also got increasingly more annoying as the semester progressed -- by the end of the semester, we were expected to complete several very dense proofs that TAs couldn't really help with. It seemed like they weren't really allowed to check your work, so they could only offer vague conceptual advice on how to improve. On top of that, answer keys (published after the due date as study resources) were often riddled with errors or grammatical mistakes that sometimes made using them as study resources misleading.\nThe lectures were also fairly confusing -- the professor's scratch work would be impossible to follow, and he would also make frequent mistakes that he'd have to rewind several steps to correct. In addition, the professor would also spend large amounts of time in some lectures explaining weird experimental course choices -- for example, explaining the final (optional in some cases) being an oral exam took twenty straight minutes. He also took time at the beginning of the semester to explain why the course discouraged \"studenting.\"\nThe class is very deceptively easy; the concepts are easy to understand, but they weren't taught clearly and proofs were graded quite harshly. The first two tests weren't very hard, but the last two really stretched the limits of writing proofs in a 50 minute time constraint. There was one assignment offered for extra credit, which was just writing some Python code, which is also the only time you actually code in this class.\nTLDR: Hopefully the professors can make this better in future iterations of the course, but this semester was convoluted and experimental"

TAs could be pretty pedantic about notation and would dock 5 points out of your 20 point HWs pretty regularly. Camping office hours and looking for a specific TA was also pretty necessary to do well on the HWs, unless you were just already really good at the material.

As someone who took the oral final, whether or not it bumped your grade was very dependent on which teacher tested you: David Evans or Aidan San. It was random which professor you got, and Aidan was much kinder and lenient compared to David.\nTeaching wise, Aidan really did his best to teach something that kind of seemed intuitive to him.

The primary communication happening through Discord was also odd, and I couldn't trust their provided proof solutions since they would inevitably find errors in it after a couple days of sharing it with students. I've somehow found CSO to be a more enjoyable class than this one was.\nI'll say David Evans and Aidan San were kind and well meaning individuals, but do avoid taking the class with these instructors if you can."

I went to his final exam review session and it was immensely helpful.TLDR; Take the class with a different professor if you want to learn anything from it.Sullivan is a very nice guy, he seems to really care about the students as people, however, he teaches the class using an obscure proofing language called Lean. There is next to no documentation available for this language and aside from his lecture examples, there are no other resources to review or read through in order to learn more about it, or even just figure out how the language works. All that he provides is the confusingly organized API. We're well over halfway through the semester at this point and we haven't done a single standard proof like all the other discrete classes are doing. I've talked to multiple people who took this class with Sullivan when it was coded as CS 2102, and they've all agreed that learning Lean made the class less about logic and proofs, and more about figuring out the syntax of a proofing language that you'll never use again. I wouldn't say that it was difficult because of the logic taught in it, that all makes complete sense and I have been able to explain why for the homework. I have just been unable to write it out in Lean."

So as long as you read the files on github you should be fine. He grades quite generously and is very kind if you go up to him for help. Overall I wouldn't really recommend  the class if you had the option of the other professors.

I think this class is an easier A, but you learn less and are annoyed by the softwares used.\nLean:I found it annoying that my friends in the other section (Orrico) had a completely different class. They took a more standard approach whereas we got... Lean. Lean is some proofing programming language that I just don't think I'll ever use again, but more importantly, I don't think it made any of the concepts easier to understand. Although he was always very willing to help, there were frequent issues with Lean, the class container, and the github repo for most people I knew in the class. The one saving grace of Lean is that Chat GPT understands it pretty well and can help you understand if you know what to prompt.\nLectures:He does his best to keep the lectures engaging and simplifies the concepts pretty well, but it is very easy to get distracted for a second, look back, and be lost. Also, be prepared, he WILL cold call on random students multiple times a class, and he aims for ppl in the back that are trying to hide.\nGrading:\"Grades will be based on the following measures: in-class quizzes (20%); midterm and a final exam (20% each); six to eight homework assignments (40%)\"- In-class quizzes were the easiest thing ever; they serve the purpose of ensuring attendance and scare you into staying current with the content (fair enough).- Midterms weren't that difficult, and they grade quite generously.- Final ended up being a take-home that was very doable.- Homeworks get more difficult as the semester progresses, but overall not terrible. Easy to get 95%+ on them all.If you show up when you need to, do the homeworks, and put in minimal efforts studying, you should have no problem finishing with a comfortable A."

Lean is confusing and irrelevant (you will never use it for another class), and it felt like I struggle more trying to figure out the syntax of Lean instead of actually diving into the theoretical concepts so foundational to this course (and later CS ones).\nThe class itself wasn't super time-consuming; there were 8 homework assignments over the semester, one midterm, and one final. Some of the homework assignments were long-winded and confusing; but you are permitted to use ChatGPT and there are office hours (though at weird times). It was pretty easy to score 95-100 on all of them. The midterm wasn't too bad either; and he gave us a pretty detailed study guide that he stuck to. The final, however, was a different story. We receieved minimal details about it/no study guide, Sullivan wasn't even present during the final (a TA had to proctor) and there ended up being like 5 mistakes on it. The worst part was that the final tested us on some stuff we never went over, and expected us to know how to do things he never taught or put on the homeworks.\nI think Sullivan himself is just very disorganized, which is why the second half of the semester felt like a mess. I don't think he's an effective lecturer; he tends to ramble and talk in circles. I honestly learned the content from consistently meeting with a study group during the final weeks. He does have pretty detailed lecture notes that he posts, which are decently helpful but again inconsistent with what he expects us to know how to do for tests.\nIf you choose (or are forced, I didn't have a choice with my schedule) to take this class with Sullivan, expect to come out of it with shaky elementary knowledge of Lean (a proofing programming language you will never use again) and a tenuous grasp of a *few* concepts in Discrete Mathematics. Because this class is so foundational to later CS courses (DMT 2, DSA 2) I would highly recommend taking it with a different professor so you might actually glean something useful from it."

She tries to get to know everyone's names and build a relationship with each of her students, and by the end of the semester she's rather successful at doing so. I felt really confident in participating in this class and found myself wanting to learn within the class culture. So naturally, I highly recommend going to class (even though your grade won't really be penalized unless you miss an in-person quiz); you'll better understand the course material, you'll get to ask questions and benefit from your peers' questions, and it really can't hurt to have the instructor / TAs know your face, especially when you're looking for help in office hours. The paper quizzes are pretty easy as long as you have a decent grasp of the module, but the multiple-choice quizzes over the weekend are meant to be trickier; spend more time checking these over. I honestly found this class pretty easy when I put the right amount of effort in, and I highly recommend it! Especially with Elizabeth!"

The first third of the course, which is spent on circuits and boolean algebra and works up to 8-bit machine code, is definitely the hardest--to echo the other reviews, the Bit Fiddling homework (HW1) was probably the hardest assignment I've ever had in my life. The course does get a lot better after that, though. The second third of the course gets more into machine code and x86-64 assembly, and going in I never thought I'd leap at the chance to learn assembly, but you do after doing machine code for so long. The last third is all about C from top to bottom, from primitive types to arrays, pointers, and dynamic memory.\nThe hardest homework was definitely Homework 1, and I also struggled with Homework 9 significantly. Labs often had an unpredictable difficulty, and many of the later ones required going to office hours to figure out.

Though he experienced a series of personal tragedies this semester, I still found his handling of the course to be well-organized and even. He clearly enjoys the course material and teaching it, and is invested in making the course better in the future--he offered extra credit for completing the course evaluation and for giving a brief suggestion to improve the course on the final exam.\nAbove all, I found that this course works together with DSA1 to help you figure out whether you enjoy high-level programming (OOP, program analysis) or low-level programming (assembly/C with great control but great responsibility) more. This course is definitely more difficult than DSA1, but I enjoyed this class way more, and I know I want to work in the parts of CS that use this material more. Hopefully, bumps in the road can be smoothed out for you in future semesters, and the course can be a better experience.\nTips: use a Linux or Unix-based development environment for this class. For Mac users, this can be your built-in terminal, and for Windows users, you can do this with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) without having to run a virtual machine. Using a Linux or Linux-based environment is far easier than trying to use something like Windows PowerShell, and is really what the course is about. When things go wrong, it's way faster to troubleshoot in Linux or related environments than in PowerShell. Also, definitely go to office hours, especially for Homework 1 and the later labs. This course is tough, but it is worth it. #tCFfall22"

He is a great professor and I have no complaints for him specifically.\nThat said, I have my complaints about the curriculum itself. To keep it short, labs consist of you getting vague instructions on how to get started, so you have to wait for a TA to help you out and half the time you may be able to complete a lab if you are an average CS student.\nHomeworks are independent, and extremely difficult. It is misleading when they say the course gets easier over time. In my own experience, this is not true because future material builds off previous material, so it is important to understand as you go through the year. In my honest opinion, homeworks should be group-based and cited, and exams should be graded less harshly to make the class less difficult.\nAlso, TAs seem to be understaffed in this course specifically. Plan ahead when getting office hours or homework help.\nOf course, if you are really struggling Robbie will do his best to help you out if you work with him. Good luck"

This course is hard; the concepts can be pretty difficult to grasp if maybe you're not familiar with them/just not good at circuits and what not like me. But with practice, it gets a lot easier. The grading is like 10% labs, 40% exams, 10% quizzes, 40% hws. Lab is great, you learn a lot there and practice a lot there. Exams are kind of just standard CS exams. Not that terrible but not that great. Prof Hott even gave double extra credit at the end of the semester. Our average was lower than previous years (around 74 or something vs 80s) The quizzes are online each week and are ok. They're focused on things we learned in lecture the previous week and the lowest one gets dropped which is good. Hw is not bad at all especially compared to DSA 2, but the last few hws get significantly harder. Overall, really liked this course with Prof. Hott and learned a lot"

            "text": "Summary: I really liked Professor Hott as a person as well as the grading structure and format of the course, but did not like the material itself. It would be wise to set aside a decent amount of your week and weekend to succeed in this course.\nInstructor: Professor Hott is definitely one of the nicest/ kindest CS professors out there (in my opinion). He always responded to my emails promptly and was a very understanding person throughout the semester (especially when he had is own unfortunate set of circumstances). He structures his office hours around the times that his students are most available, which is really nice and helpful.\nLectures: The lectures mostly covered what was needed to complete homework assignments, but they unfortunately didn't really feel that comprehensive (especially at the beginning of the course with gates and binary... The lectures felt like being taught 1 + 1 = 2 while the bit fiddling homework felt like being asked to solve a double integral with the divergence theorem). There was a bit too much time spent on reviewing quiz questions (I think it would've been a bit better to have a dedicated 15 minute video reviewing the Quiz questions so that there would be more time in lecture), and Prof. Hott almost always ran out of time at the end. For the most part, however, the lectures were sufficient enough to do what needed to be done outside of class. I spent most of my homework and lab time primarily just grinding out the solutions and figuring out what was wrong with my syntax or patching up logical holes. I didn't spend a lot of time on the readings or in Office Hours to complete the homework, but there were definitely times where they were helpful.\nCourse Material: This class will definitely help you figure out whether you like low-level programming or not, unfortunately this course has fostered within me a deep, burning hatred for the C programming language. I do not wish for this occur to anyone, but I'd like to mention that the possibility of absolutely despising what is being taught to you isn't zero. It definitely is possible to succeed in this course even if your only motivation is to maintain a passing grade and meet deadlines. I'd suspect that actually finding the course fun (whether you are deluding yourself into or actually finding it enjoyable) would make CS 2130 significantly more bearable, however.\nTime Breakdown:No Exam Week: ~2-4 hours to complete homework, 0-2 hours to finish lab outside of lab time.Weekend Quizzes: ~1-2 hours to complete the quizzesExam Week: ~3-5 hours to fully study the material (skimming readings, old exams for practice), ~2-4 hours to finish homework.Your mileage may vary, but this is roughly how much time I spent on average per week on different assignments for this class. Definitely be ready to allocate more time to this course on the two exam weeks; it might just save your grade!\nGrading Structure: 40% Homework, 10% Lab, 40% Exam, 10% Quizzes. I found the grading percentages for this class to be incredibly forgiving, as there is more than enough time to complete homeworks and get 100's on them, the labs can be completed with a relatively minimal amount of time spent outside of the designated class time for a full checkoff, and the quizzes are simple enough to mostly get good grades on (especially with a quiz grade dropped, you can take the L on one of them and still have an excellent quiz average). If you do well on the homework, labs, and quizzes then you won't have to worry too much about excelling on the tests to pass (and the bar for getting an A is still well within reach). If you want an A in the class, then you'll definitely have to do well on everything. But if you are satisfied with a B or C, then you won't really need to worry even if you bomb an exam or two.\nPossible Sources of Bias: I'd like to be as transparent and unbiased as possible when reviewing a class, but there's always the chance that I am allowing my biases to affect my review of the course. Here's a list of things that might have affected my opinion for this class: I did not like the course material, I didn't properly read through all of the readings, some of the homeworks were very frustrating for no apparent reason (I wasted 10 hours of my time submitting my answer with a 'valid' form of output according to the homework page was wrong, I had to change to the other, actually valid form of output for my code to be considered right), and I received an A in the course. I can't think of anything else that could potentially affect my thoughts on this class.\n#tCFfall22"

Homeworks vary, some are extremely difficult (hw1) whereas others are pretty easy (hw 4 and hw5) and some are mid. You'll spend a lot of time outside of class doing CSO. Whether it be homework, finishing lab, or studying for exams, there's always so much to do. The course is unnecessarily difficult imo, but it's not nearly as bad as some people paint it out to be; those people are probably part of the the 80% who don't attend Delong's lectures.

Delong goes into sooooo many details about circuits which have zero practical application for the class unless you go into hardware engineering. He constantly sh** talks CS majors and for a lot of the content if you have questions, he will give you the most obscure response as an answer. Ex: Somebody asked a question about C, which very clearly had an answer, to which he went on a mini rant about how he didn't create C and it was a bad language. Like, okay xD, answer the question??? Me personally I stopped going to Delong lectures and started watching/going to Graham's lectures and immediately had a better understanding of what was going on. My exam 2 grade improved TREMENDOUSLY from exam 1, and all I did was start going to Graham lectures. This semester was his first time teaching CSO so maybe you should say I should be nicer about it, but IDC bro was just incompetent. The overall course is hard, anyone saying it's not is just a pretentious liar. You have to put in the work, rewatch lectures, go to office hours and actually understand content. Of the required tier 1 classes (DMT,DSA,CSO), this is easily the hardest, and it should be no surprise when you see averages in the lower 70s for exams. Funnily enough, the labs and homework count for the majority of your grade so while it may be disheartening, an A - B is actually very doable even if you average like a 60 test average. Also, it helps EXTREMELY to know somebody who has already taken the course or to make friends and help go through the course (saved me a lot).TLDR; Class is hard, Delong bad, It is doable and an A is achievable (shoot for B+ imo tho)"

I found that Delong is alright at teaching the class and seems to be on par with Daniel Graham about how the content is taught. I recommend listening to lectures by Delong and then also following up by listening to the recordings on the CSO website that Graham posts so that you get the most information out of the course. The exam scores also averaged to be an F, which was quite interesting, but the class overall is miserable. The content is very interesting, but the amount of studying that is necessary to pass is quite significant. Get to know when the best TA office hours are, and I recommend going to office hours for Matthew, Gavin, Justing, and Gavin if you can. If they still TA the class, they are fantastic."

Because the nature of this class builds up from the transistor all the way up to sockets in C, make sure you get help as soon as you don't understand something.

Students don't have a platform to discuss about grading issues. idk why preventing students discussing about final grades or any potential grading issue. It is a 4-credit hard CS course involving about 1000 students so I guess prudence is a virtue.\nI can see Graham is passionate about what he teach but the workload is really really high. And most stuff is just \"good to know\". This class covers from circuit up to socket, so you can expect the difficulty and work load to be really high. It isn't really Professor Graham's fault but be aware of the load. Like we even have lab and HW due around the cumulative final exam date (+-2days), it makes me wonder is that HW or knowledge that important? And we can't drop even one HW from 12 of them.\nOther than that, Graham is a nice person: he would shake hand with you and chat with you.

While obviously being a \"nice prof\" doesn't make up for a bad course experience, he (a) worked quite hard and (b) truly did listen to student feedback after exams and significantly improved the course as it went on. With that being said:\nI viewed this class as the first class that really tests whether you \"want it\" or not. While it's not as difficult as other CS classes, its the first one that i would argue is a \"CS weed-out\" and, naturally, that makes the course difficult. It is broken down with three midterms, labs (70% of the grade is showing up, 30% is getting the lab correct), and homework (almost all auto-graded homeworks). The material is all on the website (just google \"CS 2130 UVA\" and you'll find it), but it covers everything from Os and 1s to the C programming language.\nThe main gripes people had with this course was through the first two midterms. This is mostly because a lot of the topics are incredibly low-level and sometimes difficult to follow, but also with some inconsistencies/incorrect information on slides/lectures (which he fixed moving forward). However, the first midterm was quite difficult, and even though he did round to an avg. of 75, it was still surprisingly difficult. On the 2nd midterm and final he listened to feedback and gave study guides and lots of resources/help to have students prepare for \"his type of exam,\" and made them more fair.\nIf you want to succeed in his class, i'd unfortunately say that it is just simply a function of time that you put in PRACTICING. Reading lectures & memorization can only get you so far, so just practicing and putting lots of time into having a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles he's teaching (working all the way from 0s and 1s to C) will benefit you the most."

This class basically teaches you how a computer works from a transistor level through logic gates, processor architecture, machine code, assembly, and C. While the content can be difficult to wrap your head around and it moves quickly, especially at the start, if you put in the work you will be rewarded with a much deeper understanding of how computers actually work. We had a homework assignment about every week, and these were typically pretty difficult, though the longest I spent was probably 12 hours and they typically took 6-8. They never felt like busywork, though, and were always very rewarding once you got it. The assignment format was pretty varied, ranging from drawing circuits by hand to writing machine code in binary by hand to writing x86-64 assembler and C.\nExams were easier than the practice ones we were given and were typically not too difficult if you studied.\nProfessor Tychonievich is the most wildly competent person I've ever met. He had an instant answer to 99% of questions students asked, even when they were straying outside of what we were being taught, and his explanations were always good. I think I only heard him be unsure of an answer to a question once, and he clearly has deep knowledge of the field. His lectures could move fast, but he always answered every question. If you're confused, speak up and you will get clarification. He is going to UIUC next year, though, so you unfortunately won't be able to take the class with him.\nI highly recommend this class, even if you aren't majoring or minoring in CS. It teaches you an insane amount and gives you a good appreciation of how computers really work. It is harder than Introduction to Programming (CS 1110) by far, and is also more difficult than Data Structures and Algorithms 1 (CS 2100), but is seriously worth it."

The labs and assignments can be confusing sometimes, but help a lot with the core concepts of the class. I thought everything we learned in this class was very interesting.

            "text": "I took Professor Morrison's first ever Preparing for Research class. I wanted to get involved in CS research, which seemed really intimidating to do by just cold emailing professors, so this class seemed like a good idea. I'm hoping that it will be worth it, because it was definitely more work than I was anticipating. We had to conduct our own research project and write a research paper, but all over the course of about a month and with very little instruction from Professor Morrison. I obviously want to give her some grace because this was the very first time this class has ever been taught at UVA. She told us we were her guinea pigs, and was very open to totally honest feedback at the end of the semester. So take what I say with a grain of salt, because she's probably (hopefully) making some changes to this class for the next time.Basically, we started by learning about two different research projects. One was a very code-based project, and the other was about a machine learning algorithm. You got to pick which project you wanted to work with about three weeks in, and you did that project for the rest of the semester. You picked a group of three other students who had chosen the same project, and you worked together on the final project. The homeworks (watching guided videos, doing \"tests\" on Canvas about the video and requiring you to do some research or focus on a specific section of your chosen paper) are individual, but the grading for the final is based solely on your group work.Throughout the semester, different CS professors would come in and pitch their labs to us for 5-10 minutes. At the end of the semester, Professor Morrison sent out a form with all the labs that had open positions for the next school year. Some are paid, some are for credit, and some are just volunteer hours. You could choose what kind of position you wanted, you ranked the labs, and then Morrison did some matching algorithm and you got assigned to a lab.The work itself was kind of annoying and felt like busy work. My group didn't really know what we were doing, so we spent a lot of time on the final project - but that might've just been us. The assignments didn't seem super helpful in the moment, but she definitely gave some good resources that I didn't know about before the class and I'll definitely be coming back to as I start research. In my opinion, it's a super easy A+ and the work is worth it to be put into a research lab without having to stress about finding one by yourself."

Almost all out of class time is spent on programming assignments, which will take anywhere from 2-10 hours depending on how comfortable you are with C and the concepts and how willing you are to ask for help.

Professor Floryan does a really good job taking each data structure, showing the need for it, showing how it would work, and working through it with the class. Though some may dislike the labs in his class, I would argue they are the most valuable thing he can do for us. Each lab consists of a prelab, where we implement a data structure, an in-lab, where we solve interview-style questions involving that data structure, and a postlab, where we experiment with the data structure and write a research-style paper on it. I highly recommend this class."

Since the field of computer science and software engineering grew, industry quickly realized this was a horrible idea... which is why it's interesting that this seems to be the style taught by a class supposedly designed to teach modern software development methods. According to google, a dinosaur is \"a person or thing that is outdated or has become obsolete because of failure to adapt to changing circumstances.\" Seems a pretty fitting definition for Horton."

Bloomfield is an adequate professor, but the content is just a lot. Readings aren't necessary, but they can help if you need them.\nIf you can help it, take this class with friends. It's not a high priority like it is for CS 3140, but collaboration is encouraged and sometimes outright necessary for some of the problem sets and programming assignments. I used Java for most of the programming assignments, but I recommend using Python instead since it saves a lot of headaches. Try to finish them as soon as possible.\nMy main complaint with this class is that most of the grades do not come back until weeks later (as of writing there are still missing grades for assignments from over three weeks ago), but overall, you could do a lot worse for a required CS class.\n#tCFF24"

Bloomfield is a swindling hardass that has made the course set up in such a way that you aren't supposed to succeed. Grading on quizzes is very arbitary. One small mistake can cost you 10% of the points on a quiz. Additionally, the programming assigments are designed terribly. The test cases are not revealed to you beforehand, leaving you to guess at what the edge test cases are like. Even if you write your own code to generate test cases and check with a friend (like I did), that is no guarantee that your code will pass whatever auto-grader tests that the devil incarnate Bloomfield has cooked up. On one programming assignment, a SINGLE test case was worth half the grade! Additionally, there are no extra credit opportunities (aside from the retake opportunities that will let you get back a measly 10 points back per quiz. Wow, the lord truly has graced us with his generosity).Bloomfield's lectures are trash, he just reads from the power point and the guy is an evil version of Mr. Bean. He doesn't care about actual code quality, he just cares about your ability to pass autograder tests. This auto-grader method was created entirely to avoid having human intervention during the grading process and have a human, god forbid, actually look at code!\nNot to mention, the grading for this class was unacceptably slow. It took over a month to return a problem set (a ONE WEEK turnaround time was promised). And, the grading was inconsistent with the syllabus policy outlined too! The entire problem set was graded for accuracy when the syllabus only said part of it would be graded for accuracy.\nOh, and the charity that bloomfield runs about teaching middle-school aged girls to code? Its totally disingenous. The school you go and volunteer at is an all-girls private middle school. It just happens to be the case that his daughter goes to school.\nIn conclusion, Aaron Bloomfield is the epitome of the adage that \"those who can't do, teach\" If Bloomfield is teaching this course, don't take it. Actually, this entire course is garbage, but especially when Bloomfield is teaching it. Its a really terrible course, and even though I got a fairly decent grade for this class (A-), it's persuaded me not to continuing majoring in CS at UVA. CS at UVA is just a money grab, and if you have the skills for it, you're probably better off going into electrical engineering or computer engineering or something else."

Teaching assistants are unhelpful, grading is inconsistent, and averages are rarely released, making it impossible to gauge class performance. Programming assignments (PAs) are poorly designed, with hidden test cases that force students to guess edge cases. There is no partial credit. One bad grade on these assignments, worth 25% each, can severely hurt your overall grade. The policy capping final grade scores based on quiz averages is unfair and discouraging, penalizing students even if they perform well on assignments. Quizzes and lectures lack clarity, and professors and TAs often respond rudely to questions. Grading delays are unacceptable, with problem sets taking over a month to return, despite promises of faster turnaround times. This course fails to provide a supportive/effective learning environment."

This class is a difficult class, and it requires you to spend a lot of time gaining mastery of the course and studying to get a good score. Each unit has two problem sets that usually take me eight to ten hours to figure out, get checked, and then write up, and each unit also has a programming assignment that takes on average 8-10 hours. I will be honest, this class is a lot of work, but Professor Bloomfield makes the class very interesting and is an amazing lecturer. I would 100% recommend taking this class with Bloomfield as he is very knowledgeable and is able to answer any content question that you have. The programming assignments can be difficult at times, but they are not impossible, and the class is not meant to make you fail or to be very difficult. The content itself is just very difficult and it just takes a lot of time to get used to the material and the way the tests are set up. The tests make sure that you actually can take what is learned and apply it, and I would recommend you do better in the first two units. The five units are Graphs, Divide and Conquer, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, and Reductions. Dynamic programming is the worst of it, but it is a very great class overall. Take it with Bloomfield and I recommend going to his office hours. Love the class."

I was able to complete most of them, with the exception of the first, within 2 hours - sometimes less. The PS's were harder, but they were great practice for the Quizzes and were one of the best resources to aid in comprehension. My biggest complaint is just the organization of the class. Professor Bloomfield often told us he was writing the homeworks the day/a few days before we were to do them, and it led to a lot of the PS's being uploaded at random times. Additionally, the syllabus for the class is very vague (no set A/A- cutoff, no PA due dates laid out in advance), Piazza questions were sometimes answered days/weeks after they were posted, and grading took over a month in some cases. Because of these issues, I think it led a lot of people to feel worse about the class than they might have otherwise felt.

Everyone makes this course sound terrible, but I'm here to tell you that it isn't and to recommend that you take it with Professor Bloomfield!\nThis course is challenging for sure. There's no way around that. But though difficult, it is the most rewarding course I have taken here thus far. Out of all of your CS courses, it is also arguably the most important. Going in, I was anxious largely because of everything that I had heard about it. The idea of making my own algorithms terrified me. But if you go to lecture and do the problem sets, you really can do it! By the end, what I had once thought I would never be able to do turned out to be something I really excelled at and enjoyed.\nThe main work in the course is split between problem sets, programming assignments (of which there are only 5) and quizzes. The Problem Sets are by far the most important. I recommend doing them on your own as much as you can before getting help in office hours. The programming assignments are easier in that you usually do not need to come up with an algorithm but instead need to implement one that has already been designed. Together, the PS and PA assignments allow you to practice both important skills: algorithm design and actual implementation. If you want to get a jump on prepping for quizzes and the PS assignments, I recommend sites like leetcode and hacker earth. I personally found hands-on practice like this more valuable than the CLRS textbook (which is very much optional), but the book is also good. Either way, finding other resources online (or in the textbook) to reinforce the material and practice independently helps a bunch.\nAs for the instructor, Professor Bloomfield really does make this course that much better. He is very engaging and knowledgeable and without a doubt my favorite professor here. Additionally, I felt that the grading in this course was very fair. Autograder cases on the PAs are hidden, but whenever there was an issue with the final autograder, Professor Bloomfield worked to fix it. And with the extra points available on the final to earn back previous quiz points, this course is more than fair. I do recommend thorough testing of your PA submission on your own though, which is good practice for industry anyway.\nAll in all, this course was really valuable and not as bad as it seems. Prepare to work hard, and probably have your other courses be a little lighter if you can, but it is very doable. And with a great professor like Professor Bloomfield who was both inspiring and knowledgeable, you will surely succeed."

Floryan is an outstanding professor - he is extremely knowledgeable, always on top of his shit, and is an amazing lecturer. This class tough. Like properly difficult. But it's also my favorite class this semester. The class content is VERY interesting, and the way I see it, I think you know you picked the right major if you end up enjoying this class.\nThe class topics can get pretty hard (very much a jump from DSA 1), but you are definitely prepared sufficiently to be able to tackle the difficult homeworks. I really enjoyed the coding homeworks - all you are given is a pdf containing the problem statement with a sample input and output (no starter code, which is very different from DSA 1), and you are given complete freedom when implementing your solution. The written homeworks, however, can sometimes be pretty challenging (I'm looking at you, DP written HW).\nClass logistics: 8 modules, either 1-2 HWs per module, and 1 quiz per module. All HWs are due at the end of the semester, but Floryan provides recommended deadlines for each HW (it is VERY important to stay on track and not fall behind and drown at the end). HWs pass/fail, with 80% being a passing grade. Quizzes are Fail/Pass/High Pass, where fail = <70%, Pass = 70% - 89%, High pass = 90%+. As of now, you have to high pass ALL eight quizzes for an A in the class, but Floryan insists that he will make changes at the end of the semester based on the class averages. You do have 3 chances to take all 8 quizzes to try and boost your quiz scores as high as possible.\nMy biggest gripe with the class are just the quizzes - they're straight up just hard, but I think retake policy is really nice and gives you chances to boost your grade.\nOverall, if you put in consistent and dedicated effort into the class, you are very much set up for success. The moment you start to fall back and the HWs start backlogging is when things can get nasty so PLEASE STAY ON TRACK."

The in-class environment laid back and chill, perfect for learning an intimidating subject.\nThe content is hard but I think that the grading system allows you to have a good chance of getting a B/maybe A in the class. How the grading system works is that there are 8 modules and you can either fail, pass, or high-pass the module. There are 1-2 homeworks and one quiz for each. To pass, you need to get at least an 80% on the homeworks and a 70% (14/20) on the quiz. To high pass, you need to pass the homeworks and get a 90% (18/20) on the quiz. Just passing all the modules = C, high passing 3 modules = B, high passing 7 modules = A. This is super scary at first but the homeworks have no deadline and you can submit as many times as you'd like. You also get three attempts total on every quiz. I didn't believe it at first but taking the quizzes does get easier! The more you do it, the more you become comfortable with the material, and you actually learn it!!! All this grading stuff might be modified in future semesters to accommodate whatever the grade curve turns out to be. Just try not to fall behind, go to office hours, and you'll be fine!\n#tCFfall22"

I personally found the lectures to be a little on the slow side, but I was almost always able to gain a full understanding of the content from then. The course is definitely a significant step up in difficulty compared to prev CS courses (looking at you CS 2100), which made the first few weeks of the course and the first HWs seem extremely difficult from the start. However, as long as you stay on top of your work, it becomes significantly easier as you start to better understand how to translate the contents from the class into working code.\nThe grading system was a little strange, I did not have much of an issue with it, but it can be frustrating if you consistently get 17.5 or 17 out of 20 on quizzes that you need 18 for high passes, but there were many opportunities for retakes to improve your grade throughout the semester. It was a shame that much of the content had to be cut out of the fall 2022 semester though (I was really looking forward to the NP-Completeness and Reductions content).\nThe one piece of advice for the course is to not fall behind. I always made sure to get my HWs for each module finished before their respective quizzes. As long as you don't fall into the trap with the \"no deadline\" policy, this is a really fun and rewarding course!"

In this course, there are 8 modules (1. graphs intro, 2. advanced graph algorithms, 3. divide and conquer, 4. greedy algorithms, 5. dynamic programming, 6. network flow, 7. NP completeness, and 8. machine learning), and your course grade is dependent upon the number of modules you pass (score 80% on the hw(s) and 14/20 on the quiz or better) vs high-pass (score 80% on the hw(s) and 18/20 on the quiz or better). Ultimately, we did not fully cover NP completeness or machine learning as Floryan cut out these modules after the shooting.\nWhile the course structure was challenging in that all 8 courses needed to be high-passed in order to get an A, everyone had multiple retake opportunities. I really enjoyed the retake aspect of the course structure as quizzes were low stress but would still motivate you to study. As far as the homeworks go, they are all due on the last day of classes. Most of the homework assignments took me a few days of coding/testing/office hours, but I eventually got all of them. Make sure to start early because trying to finish the last few assignments with only a few weeks left was pretty stressful.\nOverall, Floryan was awesome and did a great job with this course. My one qualm is that I wish the grading scale was more forgiving, but I'm glad I took this course Fall 2022 with Floryan."

The first time I tried to take this class, I had to withdraw and retake it the following semester due to how frustrating it could be. To succeed in this class, you'll probably need to brush up on your calculus a little bit, and be pretty proficient in OOP principles. You also might want to brush up on some of the more complex data structures you went over in DSA1, like heaps, mergesort, and quicksort. There are bi-weekly problem sets that aren't too bad in my opinion, and I recommend visiting office hours if you feel lost with the instructions. Towards the end of the semester, the professors stopped grading them in terms of correctness because it was taking so long, which definitely helped my grade, but also made the problem sets seem somewhat pointless. The programming assignments can be really tough depending on which one, but on the good side, the autograder usually will tell you what specific test case made your code fail. I found this to be really nice in comparison to some other CS courses' autograders. There are bonus points for submitting PS's and PA's early, but they only give you 2% extra; I'm not really sure how I feel about this. The process of getting an extension is borderline impossible unless you're in the hospital, in court, or a student athlete, which I feel is somewhat unfair. You also have to provide \"considerable work\" on the assignment, and if you submit even a minute after the deadline without an extension granted, you get a 0. The quizzes are worth 50% of your grade, and can be ridiculously challenging. It's extremely disheartening to be given a problem worth 30 points on one of these quizzes and not know the answer; 30 points on one of these quizzes is worth 3% of your final grade. You really want to study for these, I'd recommend studying the proofs on the slides very heavily. The collaboration policy is also extremely confusing and vague, I think they need to provide more examples of what is and isn't allowed to be collaborated on.\n- INSTRUCTOR -I liked Pettit. He's very chill and approachable, and a decent lecturer. I'll admit that the lectures do get pretty boring at points, but it's not too difficult to review the material outside of them. I'm not sure if Hott will be teaching this class next iteration, but it seemed like he was handling most of the course administration and decisions about the layout of the class. The TAs for this class tend to be pretty helpful, but I did have experiences with some that were really disappointing and unhelpful. There's a help desk email address you can forward questions to, but I'd recommend going in person instead. Emails can get lost and not responded to for weeks after an assignment was due.\nOverall, this class is definitely difficult, but not impossible. I wouldn't recommend stacking it with other tough classes, though. The first time I tried to take this class, I paired it with CSO2 which ended up being way too much work, resulting in me withdrawing. I would highly discourage doing that unless you have absolutely no commitments outside of school and are willing to devote the majority of your waking hours to schoolwork.#tCFS24"

            "text": "The first thing I'll say is that I personally wouldn't recommend taking this class with Pettit. For half of the semester, I went to his lectures and found them very unhelpful. Each class felt like I was watching him see the slides for the first time (which he might have, since they were made by Hott) -- he hesitated a lot and avoided elaborating on complex concepts such as time complexity calculation or why an algorithm worked a certain way.  After doing terrible on Quizzes 1 and 2, I started going to Hott's lectures in the morning and he was MUCH better. He was engaging, paced his lectures well, and knew the content for each class through and through. He explained concepts like the max flow theorem etc. very thoroughly and with great examples, and I did a lot better on the last 3 quizzes because of that.\nAside from the instructors, this is a very difficult class. The final grade is composed of:- 50% from 5 quizzes: Quizzes 1 and 2 are taken together, and same for 3 and 4. Quiz 5 is taken during the final exam time slot, during which you can also take the time to \"retake\" shorter versions of any of the previous quizzes to gain up to 20 points back on your scores for them.- 20% from 5 programming assignments: Not that bad, you get a lot of time to do them so I would suggest starting early. You can code in either Java or Python, and are provided with general shell codes for each as a starting point.- 25% from 10 problem sets: These are extremely difficult and time-consuming, I would highly recommend going to office hours to get help/advice from the TAs (especially on when proofs are required). After a certain point, the teachers decided to grade them based on completion this semester but I don't know if this will be true for future students. The graders are very picky and you will lose a lot of points if you do something off.- 5% from attendance and course review etc., probably mentioned near the end of the course\nOverall, it is a very difficult class but I found the concepts super interesting and fun to put into practice. The assignments are a chore but they teach you how current concepts work pretty thoroughly. Good luck!\nP.S. There are course readings in the CLRS textbook, and I did take notes on them. I think they're okay but not necessary, just take notes on them as a supplement if you don't understand something.\n#tCFS24"

I really liked the material but it seemed like Pettit would be reading off the slides for the first time, but all of the lectures are recorded so that is helpful. However, Pettit is very understanding and helpful in Office Hours and it may have just been that he had other priorities this semester.\nThere is a lot of work for this class. First, we had weekly Problem Sets worth 25% which were really tedious and time consuming. I would definitely recommend working with friends and going to TA office hours for these. We barely got anything back until around halfway through the semester so we had no idea thoroughly these were graded, but they were pretty picky until they switched to just check for completion to grade faster. 20% of the grade came from biweekly Programming Assignments, which were a lot more enjoyable than the PS's but still took a decent amount of time. I would suggest doing these in Python but you can also do them in Java. There are 5 quizzes that make up 50% of your grade (10% each) that are divided into 2 \"exams\" of 2 quizzes each, then a final. These can be really hit or miss and are based on all of the content for the slides so I would suggest making sure you really understand and can apply those. Readings aren't necessary at all.\nOverall this was an interesting but time-consuming class. Make this your most difficult class and try to stay on top of everything!#tCFS24"

            "text": "This course is NOTHING like DSA1. While I cannot speak to the quality of this course in previous semesters, I will say that it has been extremely poor this semester. Lectures are about what you expect, I have no complaints there, as they are standard lectures. Both Petit and Bloomfield stop to check for questions and read generally what is on the slides. Since the course is taught by both of these professors, a review for one is a review for both as my gripes with this class come from the structure, not with the lectures themselves, which is the only area where the professors diverge. As I understand it, some changes have been made to this course to protect against cheating. One of them is that your final grade cannot be more than 10% above your quiz average. There are, however, opportunities to earn back quiz points, so this change is pretty reasonable. However, the programming assignments, which make up 25% of your grade now have hidden test cases. Many of these test cases are either buggy, extremely difficult to test locally, or both. With only 5 programming assignments, being handed a 5/10 or a 3.67/10 can cripple your final grade. The kicker is, average piazza wait time is 2-3 hours, and you are FAR more likely to get a response from another student in the class instead of an instructor. We have all seen the reddit post ranting about CS students in academia, and I am in means saying that we are entitled to an A on any one assignment or quiz. We do, however, deserve clear communication from the instructors of this course, and they have botched it this semester. Unless they change things again, you are completely on your own in this class. It does not matter what professor you have for this class, and you can't get around taking it. Good luck."

            "text": "I would love to give this class a good review because it was genuinely interesting. I learned a lot of CS topics that were relevant. I found  Pettit's lectures to be great for understanding the material! He explained things  well and simplified concepts so that students can follow along. Although his lectures were a little dry and heavy, watching them back was extremely helpful.\nHOWEVER, I can't give this class a good review because of the assignments.\nStarting with the PAs:The Programming Assignments (PA) were basically pass/fail. If you didn't get the test cases, you failed. There was very little leeway even if your code needed one small fix to pass the test cases. And these test cases were hidden on gradescope until the assignment was graded. These test cases also focused on very specific edge cases that are difficult to predict. I believe the intention behind this decision was to teach students the importance of testing and the testing process. However, if we got the formatting of the output wrong, our grade would be impacted greatly.The PAs themselves were flawed. The last PA in particular was supposed to be a greedy algorithm approach to a given problem, but the greedy approach didn't work within the context of the problem. When students brought this up on Piazza nearly a week before the assignment deadline, none of the professors responded, so students were confused on how to approach this problem (and a lot of them failed the assignment).I do agree with the decision to hide some test cases from students in order to promote the testing process. However, I disagree with hiding nearly all of them because it's hard to anticipate if our code is working without a more clear idea of what the test cases may look like.\nNext is the PSs:Honestly, I don't have too much to complain about for this. Some of the PS questions could not be solved with material that we learned in class. That would be my only complaint.\nFinally the Quizzes:Sometimes, the answer key for quizzes were very wrong. I lost close to 15/100 points on a quiz 1 due to an answer key mistake. If I didn't go to office hours to explain my answer, I would not have gotten these points back (and since my approach was quite common, I know many people were wrongfully marked incorrect).A lot of people may complain about the policy that your final course grade can not be more than 10% above your quiz average. However, I understand the reasoning behind this choice since quizzes are more resistant to cheating. I have no issues with this because I was not personally affected (my quiz average was on the higher end), but I understand that some people are bad at test-taking so this policy might affect them negatively.\nOverall, it would have been a really interest class if it wasn't for the assignments. I enjoyed the topics and content covered, and did well overall on the quizzes. However, the assignments were difficult, flawed, and confusing.\nI'm sure that the policies will be better ironed out in the next semester. However, speaking from my experience in this one, I would not recommend taking this course."

In most CS classes at UVA, you can usually do really well in one area—like homework or tests—and okay in the other and still be fine. There’s usually some kind of leeway. But this class feels like the total opposite. You have to do extremely well in both to get an A. If you mess up on either the PAs or PSs, your grade takes a huge hit with no real way to recover.\nFor example, you could have a 100% test average and an 80% homework average and still end with a 90%. And considering the breakdown—PAs are 25%, PSs are 25%, and tests are 50%—messing up on anything is terrifying. Plus, the PAs and PSs are tough and loaded with hidden test cases. You can pass the initial autograder but still end up with a 1/10 after the hidden cases are applied.\nIt also doesn’t help that in past years, students could earn back up to 20 points on retakes with extra credit, but now it’s only 10 points.\nApart from these aspects, the class is very helpful for interview prep."

Professor Bloomfield delivers engaging lectures, despite occasionally coming across as cold.

The Problem Sets (PSs) and Programming Assignments (PAs) are challenging but thoughtfully designed, significantly enhancing students' grasp of the concepts. While there were legitimate concerns regarding PA3, this issue is likely to be addressed in future semesters. The assessments are comparatively manageable relative to similar-level courses, and with a modicum of studying and consistently going to lecture you'll do relatively well. The policy of returning up to 10 points on quizzes at the semester's end is particularly beneficial. Overall rating: 8/10 - a worthwhile course that I recommend.\nI love you Pettit <3"

DSA2 in the beginning was very stressful with the PS sets being graded a bit harshly (and I had gone to OH like every day for 2 hours), with poor point distributions across questions on the quizzes as well (like one or T or F question being 5 points), and with students only originally being able to get 10 points back on retakes.

These were still challenging, but students were allowed to work with others to complete this. 5 programming assignments were given that were designed to test the students' understanding of the conceptual material. These were doable but difficult to complete without some guidance. There were 5 quizzes that each tested a topic from the class (asymptotic complexity and graphs; divide and conquer, greedy algorithms; dynamic programming; and network flow, reductions, and machine learning). These were tested through two quizzes at a time, except quiz 5.

They were just difficult for no reason, and it seems like they should be group assignments (like how they were in prior semesters, nowadays it's only closed-book collaboration). Quizzes were fine, and it was easy to get a good grade as long as you studied a little bit in advance.\nIt's super important to start on the homework early so you can teach yourself the material early on, and go to the Professor's office hours to get help on it if you need. Also, office hours were genuinely so useless unless you went to the professor's. All the TAs were unhelpful, and they hardly even answered questions on Piazza. It was always so packed in OH though, so go early and go with specific questions.\nIf you can, try to take this class without any other hard classes in your schedule.

If you've had Floryan before as an instructor, this class will feel  pretty similar to that, and he teaches about the same as he usually does (which I consider a positive)\nThe class is split into five modules, with each module consisting of one homework usually, and max of two. Each homework I found was relatively simple enough if you were keeping up with his lectures/understand the course material, but could be challenging if you fell behind. Though you are allowed to work with a partner on the homeworks, I found the homeworks doable just by myself. I'd say the hardest homeworks were about the same level of your average DSA2 problem set, while the easier homeworks I could complete in about an afternoon no sweat. There was only one programming assignment throughout the course, but it wasn't anymore difficult than the average DSA2 coding assignment. Each module has one quiz associated with it. If you're familiar with Floryan's quizzes, they're pretty much that. In terms of difficulty, I'd say the quizzes are pretty fair; if you study you'll surely do fine, if you don't study/know the material, you might struggle. At the end, there's a cumulative final and like usual, he allows you to retake any number of past quizzes.\nI'd say the largest difficulty with the class is simply understanding the content. DMT2 covers a lot of theoretical models (Finite Automata, Pushdown Automata, Turing Machines, etc), some of which I will most definitely probably not ever think about again in, but Floryan does a great job of getting me interested in whatever a context free language was. A lot of it is very, very, very theoretical, and there were moments where I did not understand a single thing Floryan said. But even for the hardest concepts, I think if you just rewatch the lecture or just go over it yourself you should be able to get the overall gist of it.\nTL;DR Great class, Floryan's a great professor as always and I'd strongly suggest taking this course with Floryan because I can't imagine this course being as fun (or even doable) without him.

            "text": "I was not very excited going into this class as I hated DMT1 and did not like the proof and complexity parts of DSA2, which was originally what I thought would be the bulk of what we studied in this course. However, Floryan is a great instructor and is very enthusiastic of the topics we covered. He spends a lot of time in class proving to students why DMT2 is even useful and I would say he accomplished that. The class is broken up into 5 modules which are all quizzed individually. Each module is  worth 12%  and all the modules add up to 60% of your final grade. The quizzes range in difficulty but usually if you study and make an honest attempt at conceptually understanding the module you should do fine. Homeworks are worth 25% and are hard but you can work in groups and if you go to office hours and review lectures and notes you should be fine. For the final, Floryan allows you to retake module 1-4 quizzes and takes the higher of the two grades which is nice, you also have to take module 5 quiz and the final quiz which is worth the last 15% of your grade. This is difficult as it puts a lot of pressure as you can determine 75% of your grade all on the final should you choose to retake all quizzes, mod 5 quiz, and the final quiz. 75% is very high portion of your grade to come from quizzes for how difficult the quizzes were in my opinion. Overall, the class is interesting and you learn some cool stuff especially in Mods 4 and 5, but is definitely one of the harder CS classes so make sure you do not take it with multiple hard classes as you will need time to focus on this class to do well on the quizzes and homeworks."

Floryan is a fantastic professor, and really puts time and effort into teaching students and allowing us to digest the topics. But the course is structured so that 75% of your grade is from closed-book quizzes (60% quizzes, 15% final), and the other 25% is on homework. Floryan and the TAs will waste no time exploiting the slightest mistake or error, and penalizing you drastically for it. The quizzes are graded so harshly that it is almost impossible to pass without fully mastering 100% of all concepts. And for a class that has almost no basis in real jobs or computer science, and is only a pre-requisite to ONE course, this course is way too harsh and definitely not worth it. If this course were not mandatory, I would have never dreamed of taking this course.\nTLDR; If this type of work is what you're into, then you will have a good time. Otherwise, if you are an average CS student, this course is annoying as hell. You will pull your hair out when you get your quizzes back and realize your grade has dropped 30 points because you forgot to include an edge case, or a TA graded improperly, or \"you didn't explain your proof well enough\""

The grade breakdown is unheard of, with 75% being tests which Floryan will not give you the whole hour and fifteen for (he cuts it at the hour exactly), and what's more is that there is almost no opportunity to show your learning unless you've: a) read the fucking textbook AND b) done all of the homework set by yourself (which is like why even let them be group homeworks if you need to redo them yourself just to pass the exams) AND c) rewatch every lecture.The exams are graded like Floryan and the TAs are allergic to giving partial credit, and on top of that, the practice quizzes from the previous semester were so Mickey Mouse that it wasn't even really worth doing them. I was able to complete the previous semester quizzes in roughly a half hour and consistently get every question right, and then the quizzes we got were just insanely hard. Overall, this class sucks, Floryan's grading policies are terrible, and I would never take a class with him again.\nTLDR: Course is a masterclass in getting fucked over by pedantic graders for the most minor shit on topics that most people with CS degrees will never ever ever need to care about."

I did nothing but study for 3 days straight and was able to go from a C- to a B- because of the crazy weighting. Then the only curve I've ever seen as a CS major brought me to a B.

Why make a class focused on proving the 100% correctness of algorithms if every single question is just going to revolve around the word 'might' and not the actual algorithm itself?)\nThis class sucks. Your grade will almost certainly be way below what you feel like your actual understanding of the material is. I have no idea why it's like this. No CS class should have 75% of your grade be dictated by exams, and especially THESE exams. They're written like they're actively trying to make you misunderstand the premise of each question.

Also, the TA's during office hours are helpful for understanding the homeworks.\nCons: There is literally no reason that 75% of the grade in the class should be those quizzes. Further, the quizzes are not friendly, and are concerningly deceptive in the way they ask the questions. Also, the grading on them is pretty harsh. This semester, my opinion of Floryan started out pretty solid, but declined throughout the semester. The end wasn't particularly great in my opinion. We had two exam sections that were a week apart, and I did the first one. Turns out, they refused to release the results of the first exam until the second exam was graded (keep in mind the second session was the last day of finals). Because of that decision, they didn't let us to regrades on the retakes or the final. When I looked at my final, there were so many mistakes (not just in the grading itself, but how the points were assigned on the rubric). For example, on many questions where I should have gotten at least some partial credit, I was deducted full points. Floryan said he would curve to account for the issues in grading, but gave only 1% curve, which has to be some of the worst copium I have heard from a grading team to get out of doing regrades I've heard since coming to UVA.\nTLDR: Floryan's a good guy, but his class structure isn't so good.

            "text": "TLDR: Great class, great professor, but lazy students will feel wrath. Unfortunately, most UVA CS students are incredibly lazy.\nProfessor: I believe Floryan is one of the best professors in the Computer Science department. He is able to break down complex topics in DMT2 into digestible portions while answering questions precisely. He is clearly knowledgeable about this content and is open, kind, and available for students (and stuffed animals).\nCoursework: DMT2 covers what different forms of computers can efficiently compute. You start by learning proof methodologies and some basic set theory. (Along the way, you learn about different types of infinity! This was very interesting.) Afterward, you learn about three models of computation (deterministic finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing Machines) and what they can/cannot compute. (Another key insight: there are problems no computer can solve at all, and there are problems no computer can solve efficiently. These ideas are philosophically profound). Lastly, you learn about complexity theory and how certain problems/solutions relate to each other. If you are a computer science student who is genuinely passionate about the field, this class is built for you to grow your mind and thinking habits. If you're here to scrape by, this class will be extremely painful. That's on you.\nDifficulty/How to Win: DMT2 is challenging, but you already know that coming in. Homeworks are easier than DSA2, but quizzes are harder (compensated with roundups -- see below). Take advantage of Floryan's availability and go to lectures. This class has a notoriously low attendance rate, but those who attend lectures almost ubiquitously have better outcomes because Floryan literally *gives away* solutions for those who attend class. Find smart people to do homework with (thanks Nico!), but understand each solution because methodologies appear on quizzes. Ask questions. Take notes (paper/pencil recommended). I received an A in this course pretty comfortably, despite having no prior experience with the content, proofs, or mathematics. You simply need to be diligent.\nGrade Breakdown:\n60% - 5 module quizzes that cover: 1) proofs and cardinality, 2) regular languages/DFAs/NFAs, 3) context-free grammars/PDAs, 4) Turing Machines and decidability/recognizability, 5) complexity theory and reductions. If you review previous quizzes, go to lectures, and strive to have a non-superficial understanding of the content, these quizzes are not too hard. Retakes are available for quizzes 1 through 4, and Floryan takes the higher of the two attempts. Floryan also rounds any quiz grade above 90% up to 100%, which is great.\n15% - Cumulative final exam quiz. It's hard. Unlike the module quizzes, you cannot reasonably study for this in conjunction with other exams. I built my strategy throughout this semester expecting to take a hit on this final. I suggest you do the same.\n25% - Homeworks. Consists of six problem sets (proof-based) and one programming assignment (Java). Pretty straightforward if you understand the content.\nFloryan will curve as he sees fit (1% linear adjustment this semester). His turnaround for final grades was 48 hours, which is difficult in a 120-person*6 quizzes = 720 items to grade. I think his compromise was reasonable. Others wished for more.\nLast note: Floryan is mildly susceptible to bribery from stuffed animal leopards. Use this knowledge with caution."

He's a great and timely communicator, he listens to his students, and devotes plenty of class time to answering questions, but the one thing he seems to just be really bad at is teaching. I read all of the provided readings before class and take detailed notes on them, only to walk out more confused than when I walked in every time. Again, Reiss is really good at certain things; he responds to emails almost immediately, he makes sure to answer people's questions during lecture, but man those lectures are TERRIBLE. This course is already so abstract and he somehow makes it even harder to understand. The quizzes, at least the first few, were extremely confusing, the labs take WAYYY longer than 1 hour and 15 minutes, don't even get me started on the impossible homeworks, and the worst part is, he doesn't even teach you anything close to what you're expected to know for them! And sure, I've had classes that require you to work hard outside of class to understand abstract material, but the TAs are potentially the least helpful I've ever encountered. Even during lab, they seem to have no idea what the assignment is about and spend 5 minutes looking at your code just to go \"i don't know, sorry.\" This class is so disorganized, and Reiss does seem to acknowledge that, but does nothing about it. He starts off every class with anonymous feedback submitted through Canvas, half of which are rants about how awful of a teacher he is, which he then just deflects and says \"I don't think it's that hard.\"On a positive note, he's gotten better throughout this semester, and I hope next semester he can take these criticisms and make the class better.

            "text": "I took this class twice. Just like how my grade will average out between the two semesters, I'll attempt to average my course experience between the two semesters and present it here.\nThe first thing to know about this class is that, possibly more than CSO1, CSO2 simply has too much material for one semester. We covered the following topics: Makefiles; kernels, exceptions, and signals; virtual memory; process and threads, including process management; caching; networks, cryptography, and a bit of general security/network security; synchronization and multithreading; and realistic processors (pipelines and out-of-order). CSO2 is allegedly a better experience than the old Computer Architecture (3330) and OS (4414), which CSO2 blends. This appears to be true, but it's cold comfort as a student in CSO2 since the class can get very bad very quickly and still can be an awful experience overall.\nThe class is divided into weekly quizzes, homeworks, and labs. The quizzes require you to deeply understand the material to do well. Start them as early as possible and leave comments by your answers--even if you miss a question, you can still get partial credit back if a question is ambiguous and a lot of people miss it.\nThe homeworks range from okay (the warmup assignment and timing assignment) to extremely difficult, nightmarish experiences (pagetables, life). The hardest homeworks for me were the pagetable assignment (which has checkpoints, but which you should try to fully complete as soon as you can to leave time for debugging); the TLB assignment (LRU management can get really tricky very quickly and requires lots of testing); and the life homework (you really need to understand what you're doing; once you do this, the code shouldn't be \"that bad\" relatively speaking). Like with quizzes, start these early, go to office hours as needed, and write lots of tests (testing code on the writeups were helpful, and if your code passed these, there were generally no surprises; sometimes you might have to write your own tests, which are best done as assert statements). The pipeline and out-of-order homeworks will have you very lost if you do not go to lecture or watch the recordings, but are pretty straightforward if you understand the lecture slides.\nLabs were generally okay, though there could sometimes be a conspicuous lack of what exactly you were being asked to do. The signals lab and side-channel lab can be very tricky. I absolutely hated the networking lab both times I took the class; it exemplified the worst parts of not knowing what you needed to do, and since you're building on a custom library (it's not open-source), it can be tough to know what the lab starter code expects short of reverse-engineering the code for yourself.\nFor better and for worse (in many cases, for worse), CSO2 immediately expects you to have an intermediate-to-advanced skill level with a Linux environment, manual pages, and C (pointers especially). CSO1 is \"supposed\" to leave you with these things once you take the class; more commonly, most of the other topics in CSO1 (number systems, the simple CPU, toy ISA, assembly, C basics) crowd out the Linux topics entirely and limit discussion of more complicated C/man pages until the very end of the semester. There will almost certainly be a conspicuous jump between what you *actually* learn in CSO1 and what you're *expected* to have learned in CSO1 when you start CSO2. It's extremely frustrating, but know it's not you--it's the classes.\nProf. Reiss is an incredibly talented professor and is excellent at handling questions. He has never made me feel stupid for asking one, even when my mind has blanked and I've had to ask some very basic questions before. I also sympathize with other reviews which mention how he can underestimate CSO2's difficulty rather offhandedly. Again, while I think it's true that comp arch and OS, both of which Reiss has taught, are harder, those classes are so hard that anything looks \"easier\" by comparison even if it isn't easy objectively. If OS seemed to be a 10/10 on the difficulty scale and comp arch between a 9/10-10/10 on the difficulty scale, CSO2 is easily an 8/10 and possibly a 9/10. Based on personal preference, CSO2 might be the hardest class in the entire major.\nDon't take this class with anything else hard. The first time I took it was with two other hard ECE classes, and I got absolutely destroyed. Don't take CSO2 with the ECE core (circuits, electronics, signals/systems), don't take CSO2 with embedded systems, and don't take CSO2 with DSA2. Make CSO2 your hardest class of the semester so that things can balance out. If CSO2 gets you down, know that you're not alone."

For example, from having midterms and a final to just a single final, longer time to complete more difficult homeworks, etc. I feel like people can be overly critical of him, but the constant changing of this course’s structure throughout the semester proves that he actually does listen and cares. Don't hesitate to ask him questions during office hours if you're stuck, even if you might think that your questions are “stupid”, there are no dumb questions.\nCourse:This is a difficult class. I highly highly recommend you to find friends in the class who you can study and discuss course contents with.\n- Weekly quizzes (30%): I spent a considerable amount of time every week completing the quizzes. Typically, I would rewatch all the lectures related to the quiz topics and use course readings and the internet while working on them.\n- Labs (15%): I took advice from past students and always started my labs 1-2 days early and finished before the lab. Because I almost never work on them during lab time, I can’t really say if they are all do-able during lab times, but I would say that most labs are not difficult. However, the difficult ones (signal handling, side channels, etc) can take a while to finish. Please make sure you thoroughly read through the lab write-up before starting, and if you are stuck refer to the lab writing first. The lab writings are surprisingly helpful.\n- Weekly homeworks (40%): START EARLY. DO NOT procrastinate. Go to OH if you are stuck. Instead of a week, you will get 2-3 weeks to work on some of the most difficult homework assignments.\n- Final (15%)\nTA and OH:This semester (fall 23) professor Reiss is available for OH in Rice 442 on Fridays. He is incredibly helpful. Just like any other CS courses, CSO2 TAs’ skill level varies, but the ones who schedule OH during the same time as professor Reiss on Fridays tend to be more competent and helpful.\nLastly, do not schedule other difficult/time-consuming courses with CSO2.

If you want to get an A I would probably not take this along with any other hard cs classes and make sure to stay on top of understanding concepts as you go (it's super easy to fall behind but if you do you're cooked since the material builds on itself a lot). I ended with an A but probably had to put ~8-12 hours a week outside of lecture into just this class. #tcf24"

            "text": "I have mixed feelings about this class. Mostly negative ones about the class itself, even though I do somewhat like the material. To try and make this as helpful as possible, I'll give some context: I took this class alongside a couple other core CS major classes (DSA2 and SDE), a part time job, and a couple high-commitment extracurriculars. So, right out of the gate, not the greatest idea for a notoriously difficult class, and definitely would not recommend it if you can help it. But of the classes I was taking this semester, this was by far the worst, even though I think, grade-wise, I may have done better in here than some other classes.\nTo begin with my probably smallest but most persistent nitpick, the formatting of the slides is consistently awful. I genuinely wish I could link you one of the slideshows here, but they've somehow hit both being messy and monotonous to the point it takes me more time to parse them than it does to comprehend the actual material on them. If you have a friend who you know has taken the class, please get them to show a slideshow to you, you'll see what I mean.\nThe reading's aren't much better. I sat with a friend for a full day, focused entirely on CSO2, going through the readings together. They're full of broken links and typos, and half the time I ended up just googling a concept (looking at you, Spectre attacks and context switches) because the reading wasn't clear enough. And I'm sure Charles Reiss is a great and kind person, who works hard at his job and does his best to teach a difficult series of topics in the short amount of time he's given, but he is not a good lecturer. He spends a lot of his time on tangents or recapping content from last class, or going over anonymous feedback by essentially saying \"here's what people said. I'm not gonna do anything about it, but here's it on a slide show and in our lecture time for you\", to the point I felt it was genuinely more helpful to just skip class and watch the lecture recording so you can skip over those parts. The wide consensus, at least among classmates I talked to, is that the hands-down best lecture of the semester was the one on deadlocks, which was conducted by a guest speaker.\nThe TAs were as helpful as they could be, if nothing else. A majority of them did give it their best shot to help me when I came to them with problems I was stuck on for homework or content questions, but it really seemed like they themselves weren't given much guidance. One homework assignment, which was graded manually as an online worksheet instead of a coding assignment with an autograder, I had gone over with multiple TAs who all agreed my logic was sound and my answers looked correct, only to be docked points for choices the TAs agreed I should've made. Other times, I was in office hours for hours, as TAs who had no idea what the problem was with my code had to just wait until I figured it out and give the answers to other people with similar issues.\nThe setup of this class is weekly quizzes that count for 30% of your overall grade (lowest quiz dropped), homeworks for 40%, labs for 15%, and a final for 15%. The median of the final Fall 2023 was a lovely 56%, so over half the class failed. According to a TA, it looks like this semester is basically the same, with over half the class failing, so this means the instructor saw the discrepancy between the difficulty of content on the final and the amount of content he was able to successfully teach his students, and changed nothing.\nAs for content, though, this stuff was genuinely pretty interesting to me. I like learning about the software guts of computers, and there's a lot of that here. Once I was able to figure out what was going on in any given unit, it was pretty cool! I really liked the cache homework, once I figured out how to properly test it and what it was looking for, even though it took me long enough to learn that night that Shannon does indeed close at 2AM.\nKeeping it honest for all here, I am probably very biased, this class was Not Good for my mental health and I'm just glad to never have to take it again. I got a 82.5 (B-) overall, but genuinely near the end was just aiming for a C- because I did not, under any circumstances, want to be forced to retake this. If you're planning on taking this, either try to aim for a semester where Reiss isn't the instructor, or look into what therapy your insurance covers."

The class is VERY easy to get a good grade in, provided that you have or find a group of good friends to work with.\nThe professors and TAs genuinely want you to succeed; grading is very lenient, and it's not uncommon to get 100% on literally every homework assignment and lab. The quizzes are difficult, but you can ask clarifying questions about the underlying content to your friends and TAs.\nThey're also open-book and open-note, so with some effort, getting close to 100% on all the quizzes is absolutely achievable. The final is tough, but if you keep up with the content and do all the available practice exams, you'll definitely do well.\nSkadron is also super knowledgeable and knows the answer to any question you could ever ask him.

            "text": "This class is known as the hardest required CS class, and it probably is, but I also feel like it is overblown. The final's average is always low probably because people can get to a B without it and then just don't study. 85% of this class is between labs, homeworks, and online quizzes. All are assignments that if done well will secure you a decent grade in the class. All lectures are recorded and uploaded to Canvas so you can watch them back while doing work. You have access to both professor's lectures, and I personally never even went to lecture, just watched from my apartment. I went into the final needing around a 60 for an A and did significantly better than that.\nThe tip I have for people is if you take the class and want to succeed, really stay up with the material each week. Some of it is tricky, but if you keep up each week and actually understand what is going in Lab, on HWs and each quiz question then studying for the final won't be that big of an issue. I'm sure some people consulted AI or other people for how to do assignments and never fully understood what was going on. Then tried to cram for the final and received <50%. As long as you keep up with your work you will be able to succeed in the class and do well."

Professor Stone is a really nice guy, but he does not prepare for lecture ahead of time and sometimes he doesn't even know what is going on in the code that he has to teach us. This made it really difficult to learn anything relevant to the course, and I feel that I learned the most from the group projects. My biggest recommendation for this course is to take the class when you have a lot of friends that you know are good group members so you can work with people that you know. The group projects require  you to work ahead of time otherwise you will have a rude awakening when you have a bug that you cannot fix. Stone is not the best lecturer for this class, so I would honestly recommend another teacher in place so that your sanity is spared. The class is alright, but Stone is not fully prepared and is sometimes confused."

The assignments were also interesting, ranging from making your own Wordle to making a Course Review app. If, like me, you weren’t super comfortable coding in Java when you enter the class, you definitely will be much more comfortable by the end. We worked in groups of 1-3 people, but you couldn’t stay in the same group the whole time.\nHowever, I also found the assignments to be pretty difficult even though they had starter code. Office hours are usually filled with people and it takes forever to get a response, but the Piazza was pretty helpful. I definitely recommend going over all the slides and rewatching the lecture videos before starting the homework. Before we did that, it was extremely frustrating and stressful to be consistently turning in the homework 30 seconds before the due date because we had no idea what was happening. I definitely recommend starting as early as possible. Half our problems also came from setting up JavaFX, so be prepared to waste a lot of time on issues that aren’t even coding-related. Also, the exams were hard but doable as long as you study enough.\nProfessor Nguyen is an alright instructor during lecture and in his prerecorded videos but myself (and others) have had rude interactions with him one-on-one. He was also not helpful at all during office hours. If you’re not already great at CS and you need some extra help, be prepared for him to be condescending and snappy."

Assignments can be lengthy even if you start early, so I recommend getting to know some people taking the class before it starts. If you can, try to get friends to take the class with you so you can have a backup plan, and since you can't work with the same people for more than four assignments, get your peers to recommend people at the very least. TA Office Hours are helpful and provide generous times, so attend them whenever possible. Thankfully, while the assignments are a lot content-wise, it's not difficult until the last third of the semester when databases and GUI are covered. If you're able and willing, take this class with another fundamental CS class, since this is probably the only fundamental easy enough to take in conjunction with classes like CSO1 or DSA2. That said, definitely start the final homework earlier since you'll have to code almost exponentially more.\nProfessor Nguyen's teaching style worked well, and he's gracious enough to provide extra readings and videos from previous semesters. The study guides he recommends you do before each class are a bit much, and you can honestly get away with watching or skimming the videos before lectures without doing the reading or reviewing the code samples he goes over in class anyway.

The quizzes are virtual and occur weekly/biweekly, with ~10 questions and 5 attempts each. They're really easy but don't forget to do them on time! The homeworks get progressively harder and more time consuming so I'd suggest working with a group (although you can't repeat teammates more than 4 times, so I'd suggest maybe doing the first homework solo). The midterm and final are okay and mostly test that you understand general vocab/big ideas/concepts, with questions like \"Why is modularity important?\".\nI skipped almost all of the classes to go to a conflicting DSA2 section basically the whole semester and instead just took notes on the videos Prof. Nguyen posted for each week's content, which worked pretty well overall. My biggest suggestions would be to just keep up with the content and at least spend an hour or two each week looking over the slides, code examples, and homework to make sure you have a semi-solid understanding. There's a lot of resources for you to learn however you do best: a course pack with article-style writeups on each topic, lecture recordings, slides, and code examples. I personally relied on the slides a lot and didn't have a good enough understanding of the syntax for subjects like database queries and FXML, and you will be expected to do fill-in-the-blank/short-answer style code writing for things like that. And although I skipped a lot, it was more out of necessity than choice; if you have the time to go to class, I'd highly suggest doing so. Prof. Nguyen is very engaging, kind, and funny.\n#tCFS24"

The next four HWs require a lot more work, but aren't extremely difficult or extremely time consuming, until HW 6 (capstone project, from scratch). The online quizzes are easy and open note, so should be free 100s. The professional reflection was surprisingly a free 100, you had to put a lot of effort and explanation.

It consists of 6 homework assignments, 10 quizzes (Students only have to complete 8 at 80% to receive full credit and open note), and two exams. The homework assignments are definitely challenging and time-consuming, especially the latter half, but TAs are very helpful during office hours and are also very gracious in their grading efforts, really trying to award you the most points possible. The key to doing well in this course is getting a good group for your homework projects because although you can do them alone, it makes your life a lot easier to work with the 3 teammates Nguyen lets you, so try to take this course with peers that you know and start assignments EARLY.\nAdditionally, I went to pretty much every lecture, which, to be completely honest, was not necessary because he was great about posting the content online, but I was awarded bonus points for attending lectures and was able to understand course content on a deeper level and beyond the online resources. If you don't have time to do this, try to set aside a couple of hours a week to catch up on all the videos, look over the slides, and understand the code examples.\nAs a pretty lousy test taker, I did pretty mediocre on both the midterm and final exams and was still able to earn an A- in the course, as they are only worth 10% of your grade each. For these exams, really make sure you understand big concepts, the purpose of code, vocabulary, and coding structures. Be prepared to have to write some code by hand as well.\nEverything you learn in this course is VERY relevant if you want to go into SE or are trying to score that SE internship (JSON, FXML, JavaFX, Database Queries, GUI + much more).

This course is the reason I decided to major in computer science. The recorded lectures and detailed readings meant that I got to move through materials at my own pace which I found very helpful. Every assignment is meant to be done in groupwork which can take some time getting used to, but I valued that it emulated what it would be like to work on a professional software development team.\nThe one aspect of the course I wish was different would be to include the ability to earn back points of homework after receiving feedback. I think this would make the course even more realistic to what it means to be a software engineer in the real world: receiving feedback from a client and making necessary changes to improve the program. It would also offer valuable learning opportunities to enhance student engagement with the content.\nSome tips for those coming into the course: start homeworks early, utilize TA office hours, find a good group (it's worth it), many of the quiz questions come directly from assigned readings, get familiar with the aspects of your program-- especially those concepts that were completed by partners, and make sure you understand all content on practice exams (the exams look very similar conceptually but differ with exact questions/answers.\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable, project-based course that has given me a strong understanding of engineering programs and a joy to do so!\n#tCFS24"

Most of the time I worked with acquaintances I knew in the class, which made things easier, but there'll definitely be people who try to get by without writing any meaningful code for your group, so just be careful who you pick (especially for HW6, since it's weighted the heaviest). This semester we only had one midterm, but it's usually 2 and a final. From what I've heard, definitely take this class with McBurney over Rich Nguyen. #tCFF23"

Utilize office hours, but know that ultimately, you need to double check things yourself, as there were several times when the tas told me incorrect and conflicting information. Also, choose your groups for the homeworks wisely and you’ll be fine. Quizzes are basically free points and a good way to review information. Midterm was difficult (but he ended up curving it) and the final wasn’t too bad. People have mixed opinions on Mcburney, and I see both sides. He can come off as snarky online, but in person in office-hours he is actually pretty helpful and nice, so don’t be afraid to go to him for help."

Just google \"CS 3140 UVA\" to see the course breakdown, syllabus, and how the grades work, but know that it is (relatively) lenient, with retakeable quizzes, midterms that are predictable and provide lots of resources/study guides, and homework that are a decent amount of work, but are not technically challenging.\nThe major keys to success for this course are (1) selecting a good group for the homeworks. There are 6 homeworks, but you can only do 4 homeworks with the same people. Since they get progressively more complex, i'd suggest selecting a solid group for the last 4 homeworks, and just do the first two with anyone (or yourself). (2) Stay on top of quizzes. They are easy, but also easy to forget to do - just do them, they give you an okay idea of what to expect for the midterm/final, and will be an easy grade boost. (3) Practice, don't study. Maybe this is just for me, but I found that practicing concepts through coding problems was better, rather than just looking at a study guide and memorizing. And, ultimately, if you are a major contributor to the homeworks, that in itself is very important practice.\nI personally didn't enjoy the lectures, but I still went. They weren't particularly helpful for people with some prior coding experience, but if you are shaky on your Java and don't know the topics he's teaching about, I'd highly suggest attending lectures. Although he tends to go on nit-picking rants and long tangents about some unimportant coding opinion, getting over that he does truly mean well, and wants to see you succeed.\nFor those with experience already, this class should be a snooze-fest, but if you haven't built projects before, this is a great class for ya."

The tests were not that difficult and I could usually cram all the material in a day or two. The projects for the class (I think like 6 total) were not very hard so long as you got good group mates (good luck with this, a lot of people do not pull their weight).

From my hospital bed, I reached out to Professor McBurney, foolishly thinking he might show an ounce of understanding. Instead, I was met with cold indifference.\n\"Sounds like a 'you' problem,\" he replied to my email requesting an extension. \"Life happens. Assignments are still due on time, no exceptions.\" The lack of sympathy was chilling.\nUpon returning to class, visibly weakened from my ordeal, Professor McBurney's only acknowledgement was a snide remark in front of the entire lecture hall. \"Nice of you to finally join us,\" he said with a smirk. \"I guess you're not 'too sick' to attend class now, huh?\"\nThe callous behavior didn't end there. When another student experienced a family emergency, Professor McBurney's response was just as heartless. \"If you wanted to spend time with your family, you should've thought of that before the semester began.\"\nIn conclusion, Professor McBurney is hands down the most cold-hearted, unsympathetic instructor I've ever encountered. It's as if he derives pleasure from other people's suffering. If you're dealing with any hardships or difficulties, steer clear of this professor entirely. Trust me, having to withdraw from the class is better than being subjected to his utter lack of basic compassion and humanity."

This course focuses on UX design, which does NOT include implementation. We draw a lot of pictures by hand every class. We don't learn any new technology. I personally wish I took another class. I feel that the material isn't particularly relevant to students who want to work on more hands on coding projects. The professor himself is really rude. He encourages students to ask questions but when they do, he accuses them of not paying attention or will yell at them for starting a project later than he thinks you should have. The material itself isn't difficult, but it's very tedious. The readings can be over 100 pages for a week and you are quizzed on the readings every week. The readings are overly detailed. For example, one chapter had a long section on color coding sticky notes. This class would be okay if it was at least an easy A, but the graders are harsh and the instructions are very unclear. The professor isn't understanding and is reluctant to admit that his instructions are unclear. The professor also tries to make everyone go to TA office hours at like 8 PM on weekdays to work on their projects. The in class activities themselves are disorganized and required. So if you plan to take this course (which I do NOT recommend), be prepared to draw a lot and make diagrams with sticky notes because you aren't going to learn any new technology. He only gives you 10 minutes to take in class quizzes when there are 8 questions, and the quizzes are worth 20% of your grade. He takes some feedback into consideration, but for the most part, I feel like he's mad when someone gives feedback even though that's what he asked for. I've only had uncomfortable interactions with him. I'll ask a question that he doesn't answer and basically just rebuffs me."

The entire course content is not what I'd hoped; instead of a class about designing technological interfaces with human intuition in mind, it's an absurdly detailed description of ONE particular process of user experience design, which I'm certain I will never use in my life. The bulk of the work consists of one semester-long project with several deliverables, but Apostolellis is mind-blowingly unclear about what he wants at every step of the way - his rubrics and assignment summaries are wildly vague, yet he's incredibly picky about things he never mentioned when it comes time to grade.

I originally was excited to take this class as I was going to take it the previous semester with Floryan but dropped to take another class. Apostolellis has no idea what he is doing in this class and it is completely different from previous semesters. The whole class is a semester long project based on a topic that is selected with your group the second week of class. There were a limited amount of topics which were first come first serve which causes a lot of groups to have to select topics they are not interested in and unable to change.\nThe focus on this class isn't even about Human Computer Interaction but is only on User Experience.  The book for the class is terrible, it is the most boring book I have ever read and extremely hard to read. Every vocab term is defined in a light blue background with white text which is extremely hard to read, you would expect better for a class about User Experience and design. Every vocab term is also extremely similar to five other vocab terms which have almost indistinguishable definitions.\nApostolellis is not receptive to feedback and seems like he thinks he can't be in the wrong. He refused to add an anonymous feedback section to collab after students suggested it. Around halfway through the semester he gave us an \"anonymous\" feedback survey. When completing this survey we had to supply a username that was associated with our survey answer and we had to submit a screenshot of the survey on collab for extra credit with the username.  He was almost completely unresponsive to the feedback, saying that a lot of students were being disrespectful to him when there was definitely some good feedback he received.\nHe has also said sexist things that were not acceptable.

His expectations are entirely unclear and when asked to clarify he will give different responses at different times. He provides a list of deliverables for the projects but they do not even remotely encapsulate the amount of work he expects. You are intended to track and record every second you spend on your project and provide him with all of that information as well as the actual deliverables. He sends out subsequent emails after posting assignments that just add more things that he expects to be turned in. He has been called out multiple times for making inappropriate and uncomfortable sexist remarks. I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere but when learning about the ethics of human research (at least that's what I think we were talking about) he made a reference to \"the beautiful experiments the German's performed on the Jews.\" I would assume it was just an awful joke but it was entirely inappropriate. It was quiet but my group partners and I heard it and considered doing something about it but his response to criticism is harsh and we were worried about our grades. On top of Apostolellis being an awful professor, the book is beyond boring and uninformative.

He holds public discussions about improving the class during lecture, through Piazza, during his OH, and with a private survey. He even hosted a brunch at his house. He intends well, and I respect the dude for letting us speak up. He has really great use of interactive technology. Instead of pure lectures, we get to express ourselves with his mentimeter polls and see everyone else's ideas on a big screen. He also likes to incorporate fun facts about animals and occasionally toss out granola bars. What's not so fun though was the initial lack of clear guidelines and expectations for projects. For this semester, in particular, he tried out a lot of different things, but uncertainty and inconsistency subtracted some of the fun for me. Granted, he's a new professor. In terms of workload, it's harder than it has been historically, but it's hard. It was just hard to navigate this semester with changing guidelines and structure of classes. The breakdown of how much time I spent was: 30min-1hr of skimming the chapters, 3hrs with 2 group meetings per week, and 1 hr spilled over if I couldn't finish what was needed during group work. There are also 8-10 question quizzes on readings/lectures on Tuesdays and in-class activities on Thursdays. I would recommend the class if you're interested in UX/UI because the professor not only specializes in this area but is also really passionate about the subject.  Overall, it's a really interactive class with a lot of collaboration. It might take some time to get used to abstract and vague concepts than what you're used to though. If you like working in groups, reading for classes, and going to lectures, I think you'll enjoy the class. Give this course a try, it's not that bad."

Most students are doing other stuff on their laptops or phones while she drones through the lecture slides, going over extremely boring material about prototyping or user analysis.  The week before the three in class tests she releases a one page review sheet that covers all the buzzwords and pointless HCI material you should memorize for like two hours the day of the exam so you can regurgitate them, making it easy to do well on the exams but very unlikely that you will retain any information gained.\nThe class is project based, so you work in groups and have basically 3 long homework assignments, which inevitably get done hastily at the last second unless you somehow form a group that doesn't have one or two scrubs who do absolutely nothing.  The weeks that the homework assignments are due are stressful and can be time consuming but every other week, there is zero work associated with this class.\nI would not recommend this class to anybody unless you are exclusively looking for a class with as little work as possible, or if you have a serious project idea you want to see fleshed out, because if your idea is good enough for people to want to join your group you will be forced to do some analysis that I imagine is somewhat useful.

The course material was okay, though I admit I feel like I learned a lot which is really the goal.\nThe majority of the work for this class is a semester-long group project, though for some inexplicable reason, they decided to throw in a programming assignment in the middle of the semester that much of the class struggled with due to the irrelevance of it to the course material and the very poor explanation of the assignment. This assignment fell between the group assignments 2 and 3, which created a major gap in between and killed a lot of the momentum. Not only this, but the delay caused by this and many schedule pushbacks, the  final group assignment was due on the day after the final, which really sucked. The group work in general was frustrating (even more so since I had untrustworthy partners) because so much of your grade depends on other people's work. There is potential to have a lot of fun with it if you have the right partners and an idea that excites you, but it is even more likely for it to become a chore, as your final product will be 30+ pages.\nThe tests weren't bad at all, but the final had way more specific things pulled from the book than the other two.\nAnother thing is that participation counts for 15% of the grade. I get why he wants to encourage discussion, but in a 100+ person class, this was not fun.

You will learn some cool things about human beings and the way that they interact with technology.3. The group project can actually be a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously\nCons:1. The grading is super subjective. He releases guidelines before hand which are extremely vague. The TA who grades just takes of points wherever he felt necessary without much regard to the guidelines posted.2. The programming assignment. This was, in fairness, the first time this had been done so there is sure to be improvement in the future. In the middle of 2 of the homeworks was a just a random programming assignment where we had to implement one of the design patterns learned in class. The assignment was vague, the skeleton code was confusing and unhelpful, and the grading was far too harsh (I lost 20% for misreading a small, insignificant instruction)3. The material can get dry and he does not allow laptops in class so paying attention was really the only option.\nOverall, a decent course with a great professor that is a nice break from the nitty-gritty CS curriculum. Not an easy A per-se but I didn't put all that much effort into it and the curve at the end gave me an A-."

It felt like exams weren't always testing relevant knowledge but instead would ask about really specific passages in the book. Floryan claimed that he did these to test whether you read the book but in my opinion, there's a difference between testing whether you read the book or memorized it. There was one programming assignment that had a lot of edge cases to account for that weren't outlined in the instructions, so definitely use piazza. There is also one big group project that was interesting, but is very subjectively graded. Overall, I'd say the course is an easy B. Floryan is a very engaging lecturer and makes class fun by starting discussions and encouraging participation, so I'd definitely recommend taking it with him.  Just know that the class isn't necessarily the walk in the park that some claim it to be (or maybe you have a photographic memory and it's easy)."

The sum of these assignments 3 projects parts, an exam, and a homework; they were worth approximately 51% of our grade while the final was only worth 9%. However, It's hard to tell you for sure how much they were worth exactly because there are assignments in the syllabus we were never assigned mostly because he didn't want to grade them.  He made a temporary class website with the apparent intention of creating an actual one but never did.

What is even the point of written tests if you are unable to argue your point. To summarize, lectures are meaningless, the class is poorly organized and poorly taught, the material is as redundant as it is boring (the useful bits are taught in other courses like Mobile Development and Advanced Software Dev.), you will learn nothing, and you'll be miserable while you suffer it.\nMy friends who took the class with Mary Smith say she's just as bad but a little more reasonable on grading.

My trick? Memorizing everything on the slides. That's literally it, just memorization. When he assigns readings, do a thorough skim, you don't have to read every little thing, but a thorough skim should help you get points for questions having to do with readings that sometimes show up on the exams.

But all joking aside, the class was more or less straightforward, read the slides and definitely read the textbook (sigh - first cs class where you actually have to read the textbook / supplementary reading) then do the test (use the HCI vocab and stuff, it's not too bad... according to the other kids). You have to write about 4 or 5 reports with your group of 4, which isn't hard, but should be extensive and as detailed as you can possibly get. To succeed, I would recommend maybe checking your report with a TA to make sure you hit all the points they want because it's hard to get a sense of how much you should write before you actually get the crappy grade back from the crappy TA (jk we love you TAs just give us a break some time)."

The project makes up 50% of your grade and it's really the only thing you do the entire semester. Sherriff put my group of 8 together extremely well so we worked together incredibly. I was actually sad when the project was over because it was such a great experience. The project for this semester was to create a polling system for elections. We added a lot of extra features and thought through all of our design decisions very carefully so we ultimately received a 19.5/20 for our technical score (he really liked our extra touches, which didn't require a lot of extra coding, just a little bit of extra thought into who would be using the system and how to make it more accessible). Sherriff really values the software development process as a whole, so be sure to stay vigilant with YouTrack, source control, and planning tasks. My best advice is to listen to everyone's input before making decisions and relying heavily on the expertise of people with prior experience (e.g. ask people with Django experience for help, let UI people plan the UI, let the people with project management experience manage the project, etc.). This class is really what you make of it so be sure to take it seriously and you'll be rewarded.  I'll definitely be talking about it in future interviews."

It's more about going through the software engineering process as a group and coming out on the other side and realizing what you should have done differently. Though this class gave me a lot of grief because my group didn't communicate as well as we should have, it was a really important learning experience. This is required for the BSCS, but for the BACS, if you want to go into software engineering then this a really good class to take. You have to learn Django on your own. Sherriff doesn't know Django and the TAs won't really help you with that.

            "text": "MATERIAL: I completely agree with anon's summation below that this is a course you will not appreciate until it's over.  The material is dry, and you will see a lot of people complaining that this is stuff that you would \"learn in an internship.\" I disagree with that generalization. First of all, not all CS majors get specifically software development internships over the summer where they work with a team. So to claim that everyone should already know the material is pretty ignorant, not to mention that that really sells the material short. Sure, a lot of it can be picked up in internships, but there is definitely some stuff you would miss. Like, are you absolutely positive that every CS major doing a software development-type internship will learn about things like licensing? Speaking for myself, I am a 3rd year and maybe only knew about 10% of the stuff he was talking about.\nWhile I did not enjoy learning boring concepts in the moment, looking back now I definitely see why it is required. The way the course was taught presented the material more as concepts that one should consider in the software devlepment process. Sherriff did not make the topics seem like \"This is the Bible. You must always do this!\" It was more of \"This is something you need to consider in the development phase, because this can cause problems XYZ down the line, costing you or your company time and money.\" Did I like the material? No. Was it useful? Yes.\nPROFESSOR: Sherriff really did his dogone best to make this course interesting. He really tries and cares so much about his students (just check out some of his youtube videos of his COVID lectures). He is a good lecturer and does a good job keeping the class engaged as best as possible. He is extremely approachable and willing to help (Although avoid posting memes on Piazza -- he views it as \"unprofessional,\" as a friend of mine found out.) Sherriff is a professor I'd love to see be given a more enjoyable class to teach, because I think that would have the potential to be a fantastic class. He is also the biggest Dad in the CS department.\nPROJECT: This is probably the best example of \"life's not fair\" that exists in the BSCS major (Except if you got stuck with Venkat in comp arch halfway through spring 2019 semester.). Your task is to create a Django framework web app that performs some simple, predetermined (but flexible) functionality. You are put in a group with 5 people and, after doing a HORRENDOUSLY long Django tutorial (I'm talking somewhere in the ballpark of 25 hours of work if you actual do it right), you are basically thrown to the wolves and told \"Go, get to work!\" There are 6 \"sprint checks\" throughout the semester with your assigned TA just to make sure you are on track to finish the project on time. Each sprint check will have specific tasks you need to have done in order to get credit. So make sure you pay attention to that. Yes, there are TA office hours who can help with specific Django questions, but as time goes on and your code gets more and more specialized, your odds of getting help from TAs goes down. Get good at utilizing google and stack overflow -- but I mean really, if you aren't already good at that by this point I don't know what to tell you. Anyway, I say that this is a classic \"life's not fair\" type project because the project CRITICALLY depends on your team. I knew nothing of Django coming into the semester, and I had never even taken a class that used python before (It was not hard to pick up after already learning Java, C, and C++). If you end up with a team of 5 like that, you are going to have a rough time. Now, I think Sherriff makes a point to try and balance teams out (he sends out a survey asking about your experience in python, django, etc. at the beginning of the semester), but you might end up with something like 2 \"experienced\" 4th years who have checked out of school and don't give a fuck. You're not going to have a good time if that is the case. I'm sorry about that. However, on the flip side, you could end up with a fantastic group, like I did. My group was well balanced. There was enough experience in our group such that we were able to lay the groundwork pretty quickly, which allowed those with less experience, like myself, to catch up, but we didn't have that one try-hard who knows Django inside and out, and \"finishes\" the project by his/herself in the first two weeks (until you realize in the last week of the semester that your website is actually garbage.) As a result, everyone on our team was expected to contribute their fair share, but we had enough people who could help us out if we ran into problems, and thankfully no one in our group had checked out, so our communication was good. I was definitely lucky in that regard, and I fully believe your experience with the project will depend on your team.\nGRADING: Grades are kind of weird, but in a good way in my opinion. We use what is called the \"XP\" system (similar to World of Warcraft for you gamers out there) in which you \"level up\" from level 0 up as high as level 20, and your grade is based on what level you get to. Level 20 is an A+, with every subsequent level dropping a letter sign (A, A-. B+, etc.). For us, there was a potential 200,000 XP to earn. To get to level 19 (A), you needed to rack up 190,000 XP. 30% of the XP is obtained from \"quizzes\" (they are closer to exams honestly) These quizzes are not very hard, especially since he tells you pretty much exactly what to expect on the quizzes in the slides and in lecture. Not only that, but the \"final\" for the class is actually just an individalized test which asks you similar questions as the ones you missed on the first 6 quizzes for a chance to show that you \"mastered\" that material (and thus earn the XP from those quizzes back) 15% comes from the 6 \"sprint checks\" at lab throughout the semester. 5% is from just showing up to lab. 20% comes from the three big individual assignments -- the Django tutorial (which is brutal, start that early!) (10,000 XP), your role's \"artifact\" paper (15,000 XP), and your team's evaluation of your performance at the end of the semester (15,000 XP). 5% comes from small, random guided practices (small homeworks or in-class assignments). The other 25% comes from your actual project grade given to you by Sherriff at the end of the semester.\nTIME COMMITMENT: This is actually kind of a hard one to gauge. It really depends on a lot of factors. For me, I probably averaged 8 hours of work per week for this class, although there were some weeks where I worked 15 hours, 30 hours (Looking at you Django Tutorial), and there were others I worked 2-3 hours. It comes in spurts. Generally, you will spend the most time on it at the beginning and end of the semester plus whenever your artifact is due.\nOVERALL: This is a course that I came into with, while not really a bad attitude, I definitely took the attitude that this was a course I wasn't too hyped to take and that I wouldn't learn a ton. It seems every semester I have 1 course that I am kind of suprised about. This semeseter, it was this one. Sherriff is a great professor who does the best he can with dry material. The project is very hit or miss, but if you hit like my group, can be an EXTREMELY rewarding assignment. And, while the material may be dry, if you really make an effort to either go to or listen to the lectures, you will learn to think about problems or topics you may not have considered before. My impression is that I think this course can be cut from the BSCS degree requirements, but that I am in a better position now that I have taken the course."

You'll learn useful concepts such as MVC, agile, project management, GitHub, and Django. Plus, the project you'll work on is something that you can talk to with employers. I would definitely recommend this class for anyone as prep for internships or jobs."

It was really cool learning how to build a website using a proper development cycle and pipeline, and it was nice to get experience with tools such as AWS and Heroku. Most of the class is focused on a group project which involves building a website with a group that you get assigned to, and if the quality of your group is good (which was the case for my group), the class will be enjoyable. If the quality of your group isn't good (i.e. people are slacking, etc), make sure to talk to the instructors so you can get it resolved quickly.\nBesides the project, there's three quizzes based on lecture content which aren't too bad, and there's guided practices which are sometimes done in person in class which are pretty easy. Overall, if your group is balanced, you shouldn't experience that much trouble with this class."

The project is the bulk of the work but there are quizzes every two or so weeks as well as weekly guided practices that you can knock out within 30-45 minutes. Collaboration for most guided practices is required for most of them which further lessens the workload. As others have stated, your team makes or breaks this entire class for you in terms of enjoyment, workload, as well as what you learn. I would recommend this class for anyone who wants to go into software engineering because not only will you learn valuable technical skills (Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Testing), but you will also harbor those soft skills that are needed to work within a development team efficientely and effectively. Professor McBurney was great during lectures but I would recommend not doing the demo with him if you can help it. He was very rude and harsh on our project despite giving us a very good grade (showing that the project indeed was not as bad as he made it out to be). #tcf2020"

It is formatted by having lectures and the main course work is a semester long group project, that is made to be like working on a real software development team. You definitely learn a lot in this course and you walk away having built a website and having skills that you can share about in interviews. People always say this, but it is very true, make sure to start on the Django project early, otherwise you will spend hours on the last day in office hours and not be able to finish. Outside of the project, you have quizzes for each unit and different in-class (some out of class) guided practices. McBurney is a fine professor, they have YouTube videos of all the lectures and it was also available on zoom so it is up to you whether you go to lectures in person. Overall, I highly recommend taking this class, it has felt like the most useful CS class I have taken so far!"

The tests are straight off the slide sets and are about how well you can memorize lists of facts that will never help you in your career. The only interesting part of the course is learning Python, if you haven't already, and learning Django. However, both of those are things you have to teach yourself with absolutely no guidance from the class itself. There was one specifically horrible lab where they didn't tell us ahead of time what we needed to have installed and I spent the whole time trying to troubleshoot installing a library on my computer and didn't even start the lab. There is nothing in this class that you can't learn better on your own or at an internship."

Meanwhile, the Django project, which is all the work for half the semester, and the associated tools that are used is actually quite fun and fulfilling. Yes, you are expected to learn the project material on your own, but that is really the whole idea behind CS, right?

Lectures were an enormous waste of time and attending lecture had an adverse effect on project progress (since that time could be used for group meetings instead). Django was hardly covered in class even at a high level, so projects seemed hacked together rather than reflecting any sort of I dunno... SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHOD!\nTest scripts for homeworks were not shared with students and had errors that could have been mitigated they had been shared. For example, I inexplicably received a 40% on a homework before the TA manually graded my work. TA’s on the whole were very understanding and wanted to help make the class better but largely relied on the code they hacked together when they took this miserable excuse for a class. Quizzes and tests were practices in hitting control-F in pdf's and memorizing pointless buzzwords. Absolutely nothing – not even buzzwords for interviews - was gained from them.\nIt's a big shame that CpE's are required to take this class when much more relevant classes such as algorithms and theory of computation are not required. Instead of frustrations resulting from errors in code, much more of my frustrations came from poor communication from staff and concepts that were never explained."

She's not a fantastic lecturer but I found her engaging enough. I would certainly take a different, more interesting class with her. Where this class falls apart is the material and organization. Frankly, the material is kind of just a waste. The methodology of making good software should be intuitive to anyone far enough in the CS program to take the class, so you won't learn anything useful from the material . Then there's the Django project. I thought the Django project was a huge pain in the butt. Having to deal with a random team was pretty bad. Thinking back, learning how to work with random people was probably the point of the assignment, but it was still frustrating. Learning Django was pretty useful though (Although Django is barely taught in class, you're almost completely on your own). The Django project is worth 40%, so allocate most of your time to it. The rest of your grade is homework (easy), tests (pure memorization), and labs (effort).\nOverall, if you're BACS, do not take this class. If you're BSCS, this class will be frustrating but you shouldn't have to put all that much effort in to do well."

I've never been so frustrated with a class in my life. I don't know who started to say this class was another 2110 because I actually learned something in 2110.  3240 is simply ridiculous.  Every single aspect of this class sucked and I will talk about everything. LECTURE + MATERIAL: God awful. I've never encountered lectures this useless in my life. This class should really be a 1000 level STS class or something. I don't even know why it has prereqs. To make matters worse, Mary Smith is the worst lecturer in the University. It's not like I can learn anything from the material , so I guess it doesn't really matter who teaches it. EXAMS: Literal regurgitation of the slides.  Anyone with the damn time to memorize this shit can pull off an A, but no real CS major has the time! Each exam consists of 5-7 lectures, each with 25-40 slides.... and she'll literally ask you to list the 12 principles of design or the 8 keys to teamwork.  it was bullshit. I guarantee you that Mary Smith can't even take her own tests.  STRUCTURE: You walk into lecture, she reads off the 100 bullet points on her slides and you go do your Python Data Structures HW. What is so \"Advanced Software\" about that? Some of them had reports and those were graded extremely arbitrarily.  I can't believe the TAs that graded these take this class seriously. Oh, you also don't get ANY of your homework grades back until a month after you turn in your LAST homework... so if you made a recurring mistake, you're screwed. PROJECT: Smith is a fucking hypocrite. Chapter 7, Principles that Guide Practice-\"The single overriding goal of software engineering practice is to deliver on-time, high-quality, operational software\". DUH FUQ? ON TIME. I still don't know what I got on the final project, but I magically have my course grade on sis. We were promised grades and feedback long ago. Way to be ON TIME. She completely ditched Piazza too (maintenance and customer satisfaction my ass) and doesn't respond to any of our emails. I honestly hope it's because she got fired.  The project was alright because I got to learn Django, but it was extremely stressful. If you've never used an MVC Framework, it takes a while to pick up. Teams are random and you'll be surprised how many people don't give a shit about their grades. The textbook is horrific. I don't even know how it got published! Do not buy the book. You don't need it. INSTRUCTOR: Smith can be sweet, but she's the worst. Sometimes, I feel like she can't speak English. She constantly avoids questions and doesn't answer anything properly. It takes a huge Piazza rant and a long chain of emails to get 1 simple answer. (just logistical questions - not CS related) On top of that, she doesn't even have a degree in computer science. (basically, can't really help you with CS either) What was the department thinking when they hired her?!? She doesn't know anything!!!! OVERALL: Smith is a nice person, but this class is just unacceptable. I came to this University to learn and I can't believe I'm paying $30k to deal with this.  Everything is given back late. Grading is arbitrary and late. We get magical grades weeks after the end of the semester. The curriculum is complete trash. THERE NEEDS TO BE REAL CHANGES MADE ABOUT THIS CLASS. I would tell you to stay away from this class, but it's unfortunately required for all BSCS and CpE majors. I apologize about some of the unprofessional comments. I've honestly never been so frustrated by a class. Nothing in this class is \"Advanced\" and everything we learned contradicts \"Software Development Techniques\". This class ATTEMPTS to teach you common sense, coding, and teamwork; something you should've learned in CS 1110."

The class had 4 homeworks, which took forever to return as per usual Horton. Two in class tests and a final, which weren't too difficult if you review the slides for the class.

You use agile practices to plan out your project, and work through each sprint throughout the last half of the semester.\nOverall, the class is important, but boring, and right now, is just one of those classes you have to get through.

The project is too big for one or two people to finish, and Horton changes the requirements up until about a month left in the semester. The most worthwhile part of this class was the 3 weeks we spent learning Python. I can tell you the assignments right now: We implemented a custom Set class and we worked with pycrypto to encrypt and decrypt text files. Dictionaries, lists, and other stuff can be learned straight from the python docs. Learn Python on your own.\nNow, this is a required class for BSCS majors. Fuck that too. You can learn all of the worthwhile material by getting an internship over the summer. This class tries to act like a real world simulation of an Agile project. This is  impossible to accomplish in a class setting where Horton implicitly relies on 3rd and 4th years who have prior internship experience to carry everybody else.\nI go to every lecture and am disappointed each time. I don't even know  the grade I'll get in this class, but it most certainly won't reflect the material I have learned and the effort I've put forth in this stupid project.

The practice of the days are easy and are done during class, so you should definitely come in on those days. The quizzes are super easy if you go to class and study for a couple hours, and the final exam was pretty straightforward, especially since she lets you bring in one sheet of notes. The most time consuming part of this class are the homework assignments, but I don't think any of them took me longer than 2-3 hours (some were even shorter though). All assignments are graded very fairly.\nFor the homework, you can work with a partner, so I recommend trying to find someone early to do the homework assignments with, or enrolling in this class with a friend. The homework assignments are doable by yourself, but they definitely take so much less time with a partner. #tCFS24"

She always comes to class with great energy, positivity, and charisma, and always seems prepared and knowledgeable on the class content. Every class we basically go over slides for 20-30 minutes and then do some sort of practice which I think really helps. Sometimes just from slides it can be kind of unclear how to go about applying slide concepts to problems, but once you do practice in class it can help a lot. Content isn't really that hard if you review all slides (which are short) and practice work given, and she always mentions not wanting to \"trick\" students on quizzes. Her goal is mainly to get you to learn the concepts as they are which I think is pretty fair. There are bi-weekly quizzes that really aren't that hard if you study previous practice and homeworks and everything is straightforward (plus you get corrections). There are also homeworks roughly ever week which can be long (but not necessarily difficult) if you don't partner up with someone. I haven't taken the final yet, but as a long as you consume all the content she gives out and provides, the class is a chill CS elective."

I feel like the quizzes often left the students asking more questions than the professor and TA's could provide answers- often giving incorrect answers to their own quiz questions when we would review the quizzes. Assignments were graded on one of the worst timelines I have ever seen- running nearly 1.5 months behind at one point (beginning of the semester) which left the students losing confidence, unaware of their status in the class, and unsure if they understood the foundational knowledge of this class.\nI am generally very positive and consider myself lenient on most matters but this class may be in need of an overhaul as far as grade composition, assignments, course content, and professor. I think that computer science is so reliant on implementing what we learn and we were not given enough chances to do this in this course and instead had to memorize vocabulary and algorithms to recite on quizzes. Returning to the assignments, I never felt like we actually learned how to test software- we learned the algorithms, how to determine test types, covering branches and statements, etc. but we never learned new software- we just continued to use old knowledge ( Java's JUnit) from over two years ago in a core class. Continuing this idea, there are so many complex and amazing testing softwares out there, one was introduced in ASWE, but we never even mentioned them in this class and instead opted for knowledge that can be tracked back to DSA1 and DMT2."

The TAs were forced to run the majority of the non-lecture portions, while the professor watched. The homework was easy, but unpolished, and often involved little to no actual software testing. The provided homework base code was so poor that it would have been given a failing grade in any other course. The listed prerequisites do not match what the professor expects you to know, and topics from DSA2 and DMT2 would be brought up fairly often without much explanation.

We had 2 homework assignments that actually reflected any sort of real unit testing and 1 class on a java unit test library. The rest of the course was very theoretical and was not what I was expecting content wise. A lot of graph theory and abstract methods of testing for bugs and ensuring coverage. A lot of this content will never be used in a typical SWE/SE job. The class overall if decently easy though which is a plus. It's a light CS elective, but the content was unexpectedly inapplicable and not interesting."

For the homework, students were already expected to have a working knowledge of Pandas, NumPy, and data visualization libraries on Python. These homework assignments comprised conceptual and theoretical material and also programming. These could vary in difficulty, but there is a Piazza and TA office hours for guidance. There are many opportunities for extra credit (up to 30% on one of the homeworks!), which can massively boost your grades. Make sure you start on these as soon as possible.\nThe midterm exam was in-person, and I found it to be difficult but doable as there was a study guide provided on the topics we were expected to know. The final exam was take home and cumulative.\nI believe this is a very useful class for those who want to go into data science/AI/machine learning, but sometimes there were things thrown at us in lecture that confused me. Professor Miaomiao does her best to help students and is very understanding. Although there are no enforced prerequisites, I highly recommend already having taken calculus, probability, and linear algebra before taking this topic. #tCFS24"

Most of your grade is HW, and my advice for those would be to start early and get help. It’s a bit annoying cause it’s very hard to check your answers for the HW, or understand if your answer is reasonable. The homeworks don’t take super long, but if I wasn’t from a CS background I may have found it way more difficult, as it’s very programming heavy.

Grading takes a ludicrously long time, with submitted regrades for the 1ST MIDTERM still not handled, despite it basically being the end of the semester!

Bloomfield is a solid lecturer and the slides are immensely helpful for completing the homework...which can either be ridiculously easy or ridiculously difficult.The first few assignments were written and not technical at all, but things really ramped up with the buffer overflow and cryptocurrency assignment, especially as the assignment descriptions tend to be occasionally disorganized or leave you stranded. Office hours were sparse and, although helpful, definitely insufficient for the rigor of the assignments (in terms of quantity). You also don't get provided with enough ways to test your code either, so there's no telling whether your code will actually pass their requirements unless you do an extensive amount of testing yourself. This usually isn't possible given how LONG the assignments take, so sometimes it feels like you're barely scraping by. The RSA assignment really screwed everyone over, since passing the extremely basic \"test case\" offered in the assignment was definitely not enough to ensure you would pass their tests. Grades are also updated pretty late (short staffed on TAs, probably?) so I have no idea what my standing in the course is right now. On the bright side, exams are fair and reflective of lecture material. I learned a lot in this class, but I won't lie when I say that this class could be an absolute pain at times, when I didn't have the time to grapple with the material and unclear instructions on my own. Definitely don't take this class if you have an intense schedule, but if you're interested in the material and have time to dedicate, you will learn a lot. I expect this course will only continue to get better as it gets better fleshed out."

The class consists of a few in class exams, which were open note (hard to get a 100) though, and a bunch of take home labs which were on par with what you were learning in class. For the labs, I'd say most of what you are doing is stuff you'll pretty much have to look up. Like I said about lecture, I'd say each one just felt like a Youtube audio commentaries which at times can get pretty interesting. But as I said most of the labs, you just have to troubleshoot yourself online and the final project which was a CTF (capture the flag) was actually pretty fun. Each lab and flag is essentially you doing \"hacking\" and exploiting/finding hidden information and overall I had a pretty fun time for this class. Would 100% recommend."

This class is only two years old, and it's apparent that he has put a ton of time into developing this course into one which makes it as easy as possible for his students to learn. Some of the homeworks are still rough around the edges, but they are coming along as he is learning from past mistakes and adjusting the homeworks accordingly. Last semester he only had to cancel one part of a homework. Some of them are very satisfying and interesting, while some of them are very difficult, but still incredibly satisfying when you complete (Looking at you buffer overflow!). Time-wise, don't get comfortable starting homeworks last minute. You'll be tempted to because the first 3 homeworks are all easy written assignments that can be done in 1 1/2-5 hours depending on how fast you are at writing papers. After that, the rest (excluding your easy movie assignment over Thanksgiving or spring break), are all programming assignments. That is where the meat of the class is and where it gets interesting, but the time spent on assignments will definitely ramp up considerablely. The longest homeworks (Buffer overflow, forensics) will take somewhere in the ballpark of 12-15 hours while the shortest ones (SQL injections) may only take 3-4 hours with others falling somewhere in between.\nBloomfield tries to get an average of 70-80 on his exams as a whole. So, for us, what happened was that our first exam was stupid easy (Class average was around a 92 and I got a 100!), but our second exam was stupid hard (Class average was around 60, and I got a 55. Boo). The final was somewhere in the middle, but just know that it all averages out to a pretty fair testing system, so I didn't have a problem with it.\nOverall, this is an outstanding elective to take with an A+ professor. I highly recommend it."

They are all free response type, mostly asking you to explain concepts. However, at times the questions would ask you to explain something and the answer rubric (which is released with the answer key) required that students mention some specific fact that was only tangentially related and not asked in the actual question. There were also a couple instances of questions asking things that he specifically mentioned in class that he wouldn't cover and not to worry about."

I think there's definitely a rework on the overall curriculum as compared to a few years ago. This course now covers a variety of topics that acts like an introductory course to all of the other higher level cybersecurity related courses.\nHomeworks are overall fine if you understand the course content, except for a few homeworks such as Buffer Overflow. However, they do take a long time and you should start on it earlier. There are also TA and instructor office hours that you can access if you need help on the homework. As far as exams go, they are open-ended questions, and he wants you to answer each question under ~30 words, meaning that you have to know your materials and know what key points they are looking for.\nOther than that, I think this class is fine as compared to the other reviews. It's definitely harder than Orebaugh, but you also get to learn more about the technical side of cybersecurity. Bloomfield is also a very knowledgeable professor and knows what he's talking about.\n#tCFF23"

Also the content is not extremely difficult to understand but he will make sure you DO understand it on the exams. There's a lot of cold recall on the exams. Say if you learned A, B, and C strategies to solve problem X, he won't be like \"define A\", he'll be like \"name all the ways to solve problem X that don't involve Y\". So when he enumerates stuff in lecture make sure you can recall what was actually enumerated without a hint. I didn't look at any past exams and aced the midterms. So the assessment method is pretty straightforward, know the lectures (WELL!) and it will be smooth sailing. The homeworks were mostly easy, sometimes they took a little more time (rootkit, tricky jump) but you get 6 homework extensions."

The class content is the same regardless of who's lecturing, and I've heard better things about the other professors, but either way, you will absolutely pass this class.\nTry to get your cyberchat done as soon as possible so you don't have to worry about it, in practice it's essentially a completion grade.

That said, I do think knowing the basics of cybersecurity is always a good thing, so I would recommend finding a way to take the class or teaching yourself."

They usually would take the form of following a tutorial to learn about a new tool and then completing a challenge problem or two. Shand was super available on Discord to answer questions. There were also two programming assignments in Python, the first was a lot of work but the second one was more reasonable. The midterm was take home and open for a week, the final was 3 hours.

From what I have heard (and you can read the reviews of other professors), this version of OS is significantly easier. Lin is a super nice guy and is very accomodating. We got extensions on probably 80% of our assignments (I wouldn't bank on this in the future, but if you ask, Prof Lin will definitely be willing to help you out). The lectures can be dry and the assignments are pretty confusing at times--overall though, very doable.\nThere are no tests in this class. Your only grades are projects and participation. The projects are essentially broken up into assignments with one due roughly every week. The projects usually consist of a Q&A section and a coding section. Professor Lin will go over the majority of the Q&A part in lecture, so they're pretty straightforward if you pay attention (or just watch the recordings). The coding can get tricky. Piazza is super helpful though, plus the response time is pretty quick. For the harder coding assignments, the TAs will also give you credit for demonstrating understanding even if your code doesn't completely work.\nThe grading is also very generous. The grading cutoffs this sem were:80% A-60% B-50% C-40% D-\nThe splits between A+/A/A-, B+/B/B-, etc are essentially determined by the distribution of grades within each cutoff, so roughly half the people above 80% get an A and people in the bottom half get an A-. He will bump you up automatically if your grade is close enough to the person directly above you in ranking.\nI wouldn't call this class an easy A, but it is for sure a lot less suffering than other OS classes. #tCFspring2021"

I was frustrated because the grading guidelines for assignments were not clear (watch out -- he takes points off for memory leaks, and assignments with checkpoints are worth almost twice as much as assignments without checkpoints). Shell, FAT, and FTP are the hardest assignments so you should begin them early. Also, the Paging homework was pretty difficult and I had to sit 1-on-1 with a graduate TA for an hour and a half to be able to finish it because he had no idea what was wrong with my code.

Imagine combining the work load of 2150 and the material difficulty of 3330 and you have OS in a nutshell. This was one of those classes that I think would've been interesting to take from a higher level perspective but there is just a lot of information to cover from both high/low level and some of it is completely useless. Reiss is definitely a much better professor than Grimshaw and he helps you a lot during OH but personally I stopped going to lecture after the first week because I couldn't keep up with the pace he lectured at and was lost a lot during the first week (which is where he covers all the simple stuff mind you). Not to mention that it was a 9am as well, and reflecting back on it, I think it was a really good choice since his recorded lectures offers the ability to rewind back on concepts you don't understand and saves you an hour that you might've otherwise wasted wondering what the **** was going on during lecture.\nWith the lecture part out of the way, half the homeworks were brutal and the other half not so much. From personal experience, FAT/Shell took the longest and were really hard. FTP/Paging followed close behind, Life/Lottery were probably the most \"Fair\" in terms of time put in and the grade you get, and the 1st assignment is more or less a question of whether you paid attention during the first week. The only major gripes I had with the homeworks was that:  sometimes he would add too much unnecessary information which clouds the actual objective of what you're supposed to do, he never made it clear that the test cases were just supposed to test major bugs in your code and not 100% ensure that you'd get a 100 on the assignment if everything passed, and grades for checkpoints/final versions of an assignment were released at the same time. For example, he released the checkpoint and the finished grade at the same time and people who did poorly on the latter could've easily gotten back  A LOT of points if he released the checkpoint grades showcasing the fact that a part of their code was fundamentally flawed. But anyways, I can't argue that all these assignments were a complete waste of time because a few of them were actually very interesting to go through (Life/Lottery/Shell). P.S. Piazza is a game changer for some of these so make sure you frequently go on it.\nNo one does the quizzes. Yes, even I was super surprised at this considering it's 10% of your grade. The average person had a 30% on the quizzes this semester so it just goes to show little people care about the content, but personally if you put in like 30 mins to an hour worth of work into doing these quizzes then getting a 70% average is pretty doable.\nExams are brutal.  Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives all the same.  Reiss basically takes his infinity gauntlet and snaps half the people's exam scores into existence. The median was around a D for the midterm and final, and you WILL encounter questions you have no idea how to approach. The longer you study for these exams the more likely you are to calculate what you need to even pass the class.\nBut at the end of the day, he does apply a curve which is based on how many people are at each grade range, and he adjusts it so the average person pre-curve gets an 80 post curve.\nThese are the final words I have for this class: Reiss knows his stuff but his pacing isn't worth going to class for, the homeworks aren't perfectly balanced like all things should be, no one does quizzes, and half your class will get their semester GPA wiped out by these exams."

Don't take it with Algo, don't take it with Compilers, don't take it with ANY HARD CS CLASSES in the same semester.\nThe material was difficult to grasp, the exams screwed you over, and the quizzes were no easier than Comp Arch (although Reiss makes them open-note, take-home, and unlimited time, my quiz averages were still a 70, and the class average on the quizzes was a 36%). Test averages were a D on the midterm and a straight up F on the final. The material was really difficult to understand- filesystems, memory buses, virtual memory, etc were so knowledge-based (unlike 2150, where you could get by just knowing the basics and reasoning through the logic of a data structure on your own). This made debugging your homework really f***ing difficult since you have no idea why your kernel was panicking, and the TAs wouldn't know either. Only Reiss could debug it himself, and if you encountered a bug like this the night before it was due, you were screwed. I also absolutely hated the virtual memory calculations (ie, given a memory address 0xFFFFFF, calculate blah blah blah) on the exams- they were pointless to helping me understand the material and I got them wrong ALWAYS anyway.\nI spent well over 20 hours a week for this class and still got a crappy grade. The FAT read/write and FTP server homeworks were definitely way beyond 20 hours worth of work each.  I struggled so much to learn the material well and keep on top of the homeworks. I felt like I was constantly drowning but never learned to swim, I only learned how to hate water.\nIf you are a BACS, take this class only if you love the feeling of failure. If you are a BSCS, you're probably already used to failure anyway, good luck and may the curve ever be in your favor."

Unlike Grimshaw, Reiss records lectures, doesn't require homework writeups, and is super active on Piazza, so you have plenty of resources to help you. Don't get me wrong, homeworks are definitely time consuming and Reiss should've had decent instructions from the start instead of editing them in, but this was his first semester teaching OS and future sections should have a better time."

Reiss is hands-down one of the best CS professors at UVA; despite teaching OS for the first time, he came to class prepared with tons of slides to help explain difficult material. His quizzes, while tough, did an amazing job in forcing us to review the material (which let's be real we would never do willingly). The assignments, while incredibly tough, did an amazing job in reinforcing concepts. The class website was so well-organized and simple that I never had to look on Collab and found all the course material easily. Reiss is also the nicest guy--he was always answering questions on piazza, in class, and at office hours. On top of that, he's definitely the smartest professor I've ever had; looking at his test code taught me more C tricks than any other programming class I've taken. If  you enjoyed CS 2150, you'll love OS. While OS is known for being an \"impossible\" class, that's probably because only about 10 people showed up to lecture regularly. It's more on the class than the professor that many people didn't end up doing well. Overall, OS with Professor Reiss is an amazing and rewarding experience if you put the time and effort in. Highly recommend :)"

It's the perfect combination of low-level and high-level programming. Some of the homeworks are in C and some are in C++.  The Shell homework hurts a lot, but that's just because you've forgotten how memory works. After that, the homeworks aren't too bad until after the midterm, with Paging and Protection, easily the hardest assignment I've ever witnessed. 40+ hours on that sucker. FAT is also pretty hard, but doable, and it makes you realize what a file really is. FTP is just annoying.Start assignments as soon as they're released. Go to office hours as soon as possible and go frequently. Everyone skips lecture for some reason. I recommend going and asking questions because Reiss moves fast, and sometimes you need to get clarification.I recommend this class to anyone who wants to get good. BA included."

I've heard countless horror stories about OS as I'm sure many of us have, but Reiss has managed to create a course that is extremely rigorous and challenging without ever being overwhelming. The homeworks definitely take a lot of time and effort (start early!) but the hints are super helpful, and a lot of what you need to complete the assignments are covered really well in lecture. The non-xv6 ones are also really interesting and help you learn more about how OSes work (for example, creating your own shell or FTP server).\nI *highly* recommend Reiss for OS. He's super-knowledgeable about the subject and manages to explain all the material pretty well (even anticipating our answers in the slides, sometimes!). He cares about his students and is actively looking to improve how the course is taught. Set your expectations appropriately and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."

            "text": "Ah, good 'ole Operating Systems, the ultimate Oh S*** class! (Get it OS.. never mind)\nBut seriously, out of all the courses I have taken at UVA so far, this was up there with the most challenging, most frustrating, yet most interesting and satisfying courses I've ever taken. Reiss is a fantastic lecturer and if you can take it with him DO IT! While he does move pretty quickly through the material, such that at times it may feel like your head will spin out of control, taking the time to rewatch the recordings (or just skipping lecture and only watching the recordings) and slowing things down to try and understand what is going on will be critical to your understanding and appreciation of the material.\nFirst, let's discuss grading: 55% go towards homeworks, 15% on the midterm, 15% on the final, and 15% on the weekly open-note quizzes. (for those of you who had Reiss for Comp Arch, they are the exact same type of quizzes as you had to do for that class) The midterm and final's difficulty is just what you'd expect -- it's hard, but not impossible! I believe the average on the midterm was around a 69% (nice!) and the final was similar. (Don't worry too much about those grades -- he curves grades up at the end of the semester). Next, I want to talk about the weekly open-note quizzes -- I am not a good studier whatsoever. I hate studying. As a matter of fact, I am literally procrastinating studying for another class as I type. How do you get someone who hates studying to study? Force them to with quizzes! The quizzes are hard, such that I spent a good 2+ hours on 5 questions, but that is basically 2 hours you are spending studying the material. While they are hard, the average still came out to just over 80% for our class, so they aren't crazy hard. In a weird way, I think I kind of liked the quizzes because it always gave me a feeling that I was successfully comprehending the material that was being presented going into the next week ... until my confidence was shattered by the final and most significant portion of your grade --> homeworks!\nThe homeworks are all challenging. I literally just finished the last one about an hour ago. I was told going into the course that this was the 2nd easiest homework in the class behind the first one (which was really easy), so I procrastinated until the last second and started on noon the day it was due -- 11 hours later, I submitted it with just 1 hour to spare before the deadline.  Do not wait until the last minute to start homeworks! *Clears throat* DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO START HOMEWORKS. Just trust me on this one, although I successfully started turned in all of the homeworks on time, I had 4 WAAAAAY to close for comfort moments this semester, the most notable being a last second edit and turn in with 24 seconds (Yes, seconds!) to spare. It is just not worth it. While I started 75% of them 24 hours or less before the deadline and submitted them all on time, do not do what I did. However, if you insist on trying to be dramatic like me and waiting to start until the point where you figure you can juuuust get it in on time, here are the ones to watch out for: Shell HW (parts 1 and 2) -- I spent about 15 hours per week for the two parts of this assignment. Paging HW (parts 1 and 2) -- this is the HARDEST lab, at least in terms of understandability. It is one of the harder topics in the course, combined with some really weird C syntax quirks that make this lab next to impossible without TA help. I also spent about 15 hours per week for 2 weeks on this lab. FAT HW (Part 1 only) -- Part 1 is the LONGEST lab. I spent 24 hours (no, that is not a typo) the first week on FAT. In terms of conceptualization, it is not a super difficult topic to understand, but getting started is very challenging. You will end up writing somewhere in the ballpark of 300-650 lines of code for this lab over the course of two weeks. The problem is that, as you will find out, getting  started on labs (knowing where to begin) is difficult and takes time. Now, combine that with an unbalanced lab where 75% of the coding is done in part 1. That is FAT part 1. This was THE ONLY LAB excluding the first one where I put my full attention into the assignment before the day it was due -- and this was also the lab that I submitted 24 seconds before the deadline. By the way, part 2 of this lab took me 4 hours. (Reiss, if you are reading this, please make FAT more balanced, thanks!). All that said though, if you do miss a deadline, it is not the end of the world. In what might be the most generous grading policy at UVA, you can turn in the homework up to 3 days late for 90% credit. Not bad!\n* Note, many of the time estimates for later assignments might be a little biased since starting with the Threading HW we were not at school to COVID. This caused Office Hour issues such that is was much harder to get the help you needed.*\nMy thoughts on the homeworks in general are this: they will be frustrating, you might feel as though success is gained through random and lucky changes to various wonky C functions, and some of the harder things to implement might not seem related (Seriously, does Prof Reiss have a string parsing fetish?); HOWEVER, these are the 2nd most satisfying and fulfilling homeworks you will complete behind only 2150. You will learn a lot, and it will develop problem solving skills. One last note on the homeworks, specifically office hours. DO NOT be that person that asks a TA to walk you through the entire solution and take a literal hour when the queue has over 30 people on it (Has happened multiple times). It is rude, it is selfish, and it defeats the whole point of the class. Sure, 15-20 minutes is reasonable when you just have that one bug you cannot figure out and when OH is not busy, but please think about others too. Come to OH with specific questions, or if you are confused and don't know where to start, ask at a high level where to start. Don't ask TAs where to start coding without trying to figure out what you are actually doing. Okay, rant over.\nIn conclusion, Reiss is a great lecturer (my favorite at UVA thus far), you will learn a crap ton, and the homeworks are hard. But, if you come into the course with a good attitude (and probably not with a super hard schedule) it won't be so bad. In fact, you might even find yourself enjoying it. Time: expect around 20 hours of commitment per week in studying, lectures, quizzes, and homeworks. Expect to be completely lost at times, but know that it will all work out and you will be just fine!"

His homework writeups are phenomenal - providing step by step instructions of what needs to be done to complete the assignment.  One warning - there is a significant step up in homework difficulty after the midterm . Paging, FAT, and Twophase were the three hardest of the semester by far for me. But if you are willing to dedicate enough time to the class, all the homeworks are doable. OS is the big bad wolf of the CS department, but honestly if you take it with Reiss it isn't  that bad (at least, not as horrible as I was expecting based on the things I had heard going in). Of course it's still very challenging, but he makes it manageable. Strongly recommend taking OS with Reiss if you can."

            "text": "This class singlehandedly ruined my semester. The assignments were brutal, poorly explained, and relied heavily upon students having an intrinsic understanding of Operating Systems. I typically don't complain about courses, and I actually appreciate when courses challenge me and force me to learn. I enjoyed, or at least appreciated,  2150, 3330, and 4102 for that very reason. However, the difference is that after all the work in those classes, I felt as though I could actually recreate my solutions to problems from scratch if asked. The lectures in this class were pointless; I just watched Reiss's lectures online.  I think the greatest example of the lack of learning in this class is represented by the fact that the class averaged a 55 on a midterm that covered effectively just the basics. No actual learning has taken place in this class; any homework I have actually finished comes from a combination of randomly changing different C functions, me attending 15 + hours of Office Hours a week, and luck. There is no support system in place for students who don't automatically understand the course material.  An understanding of Operating Systems is actually fairly critical to being a competent software engineer; however, I have no doubt that in 3 months I will have forgotten everything covered in this course. There is a reason why common practice for students is to save this course until your final semester when grades don't matter. Taking this course has made me regret my decision to pursue a BS in CS.  Yongwhi is a really nice person, and I don't blame him at all for what this course has turned into."

If you put in the work, you will come away with a strong understanding of operating systems. This means actually reading the textbook when he tells you to and starting homeworks early. The homeworks were hard. I agree with the other review that said they take ~20 hours each to do. That's accurate for the first and third homeworks. However, there are only 5 of them, so the weekly workload of ~10 hours per week is not unreasonably bad. What I never understood was why people continued to put off starting the homeworks after the first one. There was no excuse in my opinion for people not being able to finish the third homework. It was announced 3 weeks in advance and we went over a solution to the hardest part of it in class 1.5 weeks before the due date. I know many people started this homework late and had trouble finishing it. That reflects on them, not the class. The homework was hard but it was doable. HW2 and HW5 were very easy and helped to offset the other 3 from a difficulty perspective.\nThe tests were very reasonable in that they didn't ask absurd questions about small details in the textbook - they tested important concepts that Grimshaw emphasized in class. I saw one reviewer mentions \"missing one line of code? -40 % on your exam\". This is true. Grimshaw announces at the beginning of the course that there will be one problem on synchronization that will be 40% of the midterm and 25% of the final. He tells you the problem in advance and emphasizes that if there is one thing to take away from the class, the solution to this particular problem is it. Answering this problem is easy - either memorize or understand a 10 line solution to a synchronization problem. It's announced so far in advance and repeated so often that I see no reason for people to complain about it being unfair. Aside from the big synchronization problems, the tests are either straightforward conceptual problems or coding problems similar to homework problems. Grimshaw has something called a \"No BS bonus\" where if you leave a problem blank, you get 20% of the points. If you give a wrong solution, you get no points. To the person who complained about \"-40%\", this policy was explained in advance. If you are not confident about your answer, take the no BS bonus, don't put something wrong down.\nThe bad: the end of the course was a mess. We had two homeworks due in the 1.5 weeks after thanksgiving, and did not recieve feedback until well after the final. The grading criteria for these homeworks was not specified well in advance, and many people got 0s on the code portion because of this. They were allowed to resubmit, but the criteria should have been specified beforehand to avoid this problem. It was unreasonable to have students redo homeworks during finals because the instructions were not clear.\nOverall, this is a good course and Grimshaw is a good lecturer. The homeworks and material are hard, but that is to be expected from a 4000 level course. This isn't databases - it's not a GPA booster. It's a follow on to computer architecture. It is very possible to get a B in the course with a reasonable level of effort. Expect to work hard and you will do well."

This would be fine, except for the fact that the instructions for how this report was to be structured was very vague and did not line up with what the graders were looking for. Furthermore, we were not given any sort of written assignment template until AFTER the first assignment was due, and the template we were given was impossibly vague. That is to say that the written response template focused on restating the problem our homework was meant to solve and then describing our particular solution to the problem, including any data structures or algorithms we designed to complete the assignment. The template gave me, and judging by the grades every time, others, the impression that we were to describe how we, as an individual, approached the assignment; however, the TAs were told to grade based on how well we restated what was already described at length in class. While there is certainly merit to demonstrating that you understood the general solution, this was NOT the made clear in what little directions we were provided, as I feel I was grading relatively arbitrarily because of this. We were provided with a sample report at the start of the semester, BUT it was written for a different class, was over a decade old, and did not even use the same sections we were told to use, making the sample document effectively worthless.\nAdditionally, the massive grade penalty incurred by failure to turn in the homework was, as I understood, new this semester. A particularly high number of students, myself included, were forced to turn in several assignments late simply because the required a great deal of time and effort that not all of us could offer by the deadlines, which was a fact the instructor was well aware of from teaching the class for around a decade. He even joked repeatedly how ~40% of the class received an incomplete in the prior semester because they could not finish the assignments on time. Instead of redesigning or otherwise simplifying the problem assignments in response to the obvious issues they had posed in past semesters, we were given the exact same homework assignments, often without the dates changed over from last semester. Additionally, while several issues were known from previous semesters (such as information in the problem description being incorrect or incomplete), the problem description documents were never updated. Instead, we were forced to meticulously watch Piazza for every single post or response to learn about the small (and big) special cases that were never specified in the problem statement. This was endlessly frustrating, and reflects on the poor understanding of the professor on how to assign useful, fair, and effective graded assignments.\nWhile I learned a \"great deal\" in this course, it was despite the course layout and content, not because of it. This class represents a very important part of any CS curriculum, and it is clearly in need of significant restructuring. Because of how long this class has been taught by this instructor, it is doubly shameful to not have figured out the most basic issues by this point."

It may no longer be relevant to anyone taking this class, but it should be out there. Professor Wong is very nice in person but that does not translate over to classroom. He is essentially impossible to follow in class. His lectures have very little structure, but he roughly follows the textbook. You'll have to read the chapters multiple times to get a visceral knowledge of the material, but I guess that goes without saying. He sometimes covers material not in the textbook, or he simply does not assign the corresponding sections for reading. These will almost certainly end up on the exam, even if he only spent a few minutes talking about them. You will need to take good notes, which is quite the challenge given his particular style of writing and erasing stuff on the board.\nMy major issue with him has been his exams. He does not give students enough time to approach problems. The average on the second test was on the fifties. Many turned in exams with multiple blank pages. He gives sample problems, which look nothing like the questions on the actual exam. We also only had one homework assignment for the entire semester. It is good that you are not overwhelmed with work as we all were with CS2150, but at the same time you get no practice.\nI personally enjoyed the programming projects. They are not trivial, but you'll have fun if you like C and low-level programming. However, you may notice that some of the projects are not designed very well. They are almost certainly projects designed by other institutions and sometimes the requirements carelessly modified, which could lead to confusion."

He asks a lot of questions, and if no one answers he will wait until someone does, or make everyone stand and then wait for someone to answer.\nThe course itself if very different from what you think a typical OS course would be like. Evans makes you use Rust, a new programming language developed my Mozilla, that isn't event in version 1.0 yet. This is honestly the biggest complain about this class. Rust doesn't have much documentation at the time of writing, since it's still in development. This causes a bunch of problems, since no one knows how this language works, and it's difficult to Google a solution to your problem. A lot of the homework assignments are less about how to solve an OS problem, and more about how to solve an OS problem in Rust.\nRust aside, Evans covers many topics, from scheduling to kernels, and does an okay job doing so. The class consists of 4 problem sets (done in groups), two tests, and a final project. The final project can really be whatever you want it to be, as long as it's challenging.\nOverall the class wasn't too hard, but I didn't personally find it very fulfilling, it just became another course we have to get through. I hear Grimshaw's class is more along the lines of a typical OS class, and I'd probably recommend you take it with him until Rust 1.0 is released."

The course material itself is interesting, but the way that it was presented was extremely hard to follow. The lectures did not follow a clear, logical flow. Final grades are broken down into 20% weekly quizzes, 60% homeworks, and 20% final. The homework assignments came about weekly and required several hours of coding how networks work, which often came with dealing with bugs in the simulator that was provided or with built-in Python modules rather than demonstrating understanding of the concepts. The quizzes were similar to that of CSO2: a few questions worth about 4 points each, so missing one would get you a failing grade on the quiz.\nI had gone to Reiss's office hours for a plan to succeed in this class when I was struggling to get the material to stick. Instead, he berated me for an hour, said that I was not using the skills of a professional software developer, and told me to post my questions on Piazza. His responses on Piazza were timely, but with a small number of TAs for a class of 50+ students, the course experience was miserable."

For one of the labs he gave us broken skeleton code that didn’t even compile because it had syntax errors. One of the other labs (tcp) was just insanely hard, possibly the hardest assignment I have ever had for any CS class.  One of the exams had ambiguous questions on it and graham doesn’t do regrades, so if you put the wrong answer you just got shafted.

The class had interesting assignments and Professor Graham cares about what he teaches. On top the exams weren't terrible and he scrapped some assignments due to the online learning. There was one issue however with final grades. We were given a deadline on SIS to choose whether to make the class pass/fail or count for GPA. The entire year Professor Graham had a syllabus on his website that statedHome Work\t30%Midterm I\t15%Midterm II\t20%Final Project\t25%Scribing\t10%We will use collab, grading cuts off.We do not round grades. 92.99% is not ≥ 93% and thus is an A- not an A.\nI and the rest of the class was surprised to learn that these were not the grading bands and that rather than an A being a 93% as stated above it was a 95%. This was told to the class AFTER the deadline had passed to choose pass/fail or not and so the class had no chance to make this informed decision. According to the Professor \"we will use collab, grading cuts off\" is actually saying that grading will use the collab default bands which list a 95% as an A (despite a conflict between syllabus and collab grade breakdowns earlier in the semester where he said to trust the syllabus not collab). The professor then said that listing a 92.99% as an A- and 93% as an A immediately afterward is merely an example of what rounding is, and that it does not apply to the syllabus bands. This was misleading at its very best and neglected to ever give the class any grading scheme in the syllabus. The class obviously went with what was written in the syllabus and all assumed that the numbers written were examples of what the class was doing.After bringing this to light, the professor stated online that the syllabus was clear and rather than acknowledge the entire class had been misled (and based grading decisions after it), he changed his website to say \"We do not round grades.\" only, which does nothing once grades have already been submitted.Overall, I enjoyed the class and the assignments were fun, but I felt the grading situation at the end was unfair to several who were making GPA decisions for grad school or other pursuits and out of character for previous classes I've had with Professor Graham,"

Often when teaching, it feels like he's jumping around and it's not very clear how the concepts he's teaching are related to each other which makes following his teaching better. Often I found that the textbook said what he was trying to say much better. But his disorganization is most felt on the homework. You know how in CS 2150 or Operating Systems you have basically a super in depth README file that gives all the instructions for the homework? Those were great, and when I took those courses I felt that the Professors (Bloomfield and Riess) did a great job of constantly updating the instructions/code so that it was as clear as possible. Graham instructions are ~very~ bad compared to those, and literally every assignment/email I've see written by him has grammatical/spelling errors which make the instructions even harder to understand.\nHere's one example of his disorganization: I was working on an assignment (laptop receiver) and I felt like the instructions were clearly lacking some details about how to do what it was asking us to do. In discord I read about what some other people did but didn't understand why they did it. Turns out, the week before Graham had posted something in discord with the missing info. But he didn't send and email out about it or pin the message, so it was only helpful to those who happened to see it. I feel like Riess or Bloomfield would have surely sent out an email with the missing info.\nAlso, it's really hard to start homework early for this class because it's almost guaranteed that due to poor instructions, students will run into issues. So it's better to wait for early students to run into problems and then to read over how they fixed the issues in discord after they get help. Once I decided to start the homework early and finished it, only to have Graham change the files we needed to submit after the assignment had already been out for a week and I had to go back and change some stuff to make sure my deliverable was correct.\nOverall, you might still want to take this class if you want a class that isn't too intense or if you really feel like you want to learn more about networks, but honestly I feel like you could learn more/faster about networks if you read a textbook or found an online class. Also, even though this class may not be the hardest elective, Graham has the threshold for an A be a 95 which is very annoying"

You have to remember how many different protocols work in the class and the projects are confusing if you don't ask for help from TAs. That said, I missed a lot of lectures and still did well on the second exam, so if you're a more attentive student, you can still do well. I would recommend CS majors take the class if they're interested in web dev or just looking for a fun, not-difficult elective.

He frequently does interactive lectures with the whole class that kept me engaged. The assignments weren't too bad we had 3 homeworks and 5 projects. The homeworks were pretty straightforward and you could just read over the slides. The projects involved some simple python coding and none of them took more than a few hours. Also, we got 6 free extension days that we could use across the semester for any assignment which was pretty nice. There were 2 exams that were both pretty doable - I recommend doing the exams from past semesters to study.\nOverall: Solid CS elective, learned a lot but not super challenging material, good professor, not too much work outside of lectures"

However, there were definitely stretches of the semester where the lecture material was 90% bio with only minor CS tie-ins. The topics were very interesting to me and sometimes Evans was a good lecturer and sometimes he got way too distracted by tangents.\nFor assignments, the class had 2 partner jupyter notebook projects, which were pretty hard but doable, and 3 in-class paper quizzes, which were pretty fair. It also had a large open-ended final group project that you started less than a month into the semester. The projects ranged in scope and relation to CS -- my group's felt more like a high school research project, but others coded a bio simulator. It felt like Evans expected you to put a lot of time in but most people didn't. There were readings for the first half of the semester but you didn't really have to do them. The saving grace was that he grades on essentially a poor/fair/good/great scale and as long as you get mostly good/greats (very doable), you'll get an A. #tCFfall22"

If you went to office hours if you were struggling, you would be just fine because the TAs were super helpful. Also, looking at lecture slides helped a lot with completing the homeworks as they sometimes contained the formulas that you needed.

Professor Behl is definitely knowledgeable and passionate about the work he's doing but he failed to incorporate his passion into lectures. Most of the lectures were just him reading slides and showing us how the math should look like. The pace of lectures is slow and the material is pretty dry.In addition to boring lectures, the planning of the class is also extremely bad as the first half of the semester is just following online tutorials for ROS. Professor Behl could have just assign a simple assignment for students to learn ROS online within a week, but he chose to spend about five weeks just showing students what is online. In the second half the semester, we began to teach techniques for PID control. mapping etc. But we do not have enough time to put these concepts into the actual algorithm and he canceled several classes without telling us beforehand. By the end we only have about three weeks to actually work the algorithm for racing the car during the final-exam period. The poor planing of the class would disappoint students who come to the class with high expectation of designing a cool F1/10 racing car.Even though he mentioned that Machine Learning might be covered in the lecture and would be helpful for the final demo, there is little time to actually implement it into the design.. There is only one TA for the class but he is very helpful (more helpful than lecturer)"

The professor has a passion for autonomous driving and has the knowledge but puts very little effort into teaching the class. You randomly get sent classes to watch on YouTube on no particular schedule and watch someone read off slides. This year we have not gotten to a significant amount of the material listed on the syllabus - which is not an actual syllabus but an outdated website from past semesters (like a lot of other material in this course). It's now one week before the end of the semester and we have submitted a single assignment in March which has still not been graded. Might as well just watch YouTube!"

By the end of this course, you will have programmed a small car to drive around a track, avoid obstacles, and race other cars all by itself. The lectures themselves are not super interesting and the professor is not super engaging, and I stopped going to lectures about halfway through the semester. All the work in this class is done with a group - which can be good or bad depending on what your group is like. The time you spend is also kinda erratic as you will go 2 weeks without doing anything and then have to spend many hours straight working on your car in the days leading up to each demo. I learned a bit of ROS but the programming is mostly just simple python. It was nice to have a class that I didn't have to think about most weeks and barely had to attend lectures. The grading is pretty easy too, there are tons of free points on every assignment so it's almost impossible to get a bad grade. Overall, it was a pretty unique class and you will almost definitely get an A if you do the work."

Class lectures were pretty boring, I don't feel like I really learned anything valuable from them. Halfway through the semester, half of the class was no longer coming. The professor sometimes talked about real world applications of how autonomous cars work which was somewhat interesting, but not super engaging.\nGrading was based on 5 assignments, slowly building up to creating a fully autonomous race car. The cars are already all pre-built, so you don't need to worry about that. Additionally, you're given most of the skeleton code, and really just have to fill out a few functions or files here and there. All coding is just in python, so really it's not too bad. You'll have \"race days\" where everyone gets to put their car on the track to see how fast they can go compared to each other. The track & F1/Tenth room is on second floor in Rice, all students have access to that room w/ their ID.\nYou're put in a group of 4-5 students on a team for the semester, each team is given one car and one computer to connect to the car. A little annoying that you have to use the computer whenever you want to work on the car, which can slow down work especially when you're in a group of 5.\nLots of time just spent debugging, as the actual code-writing isn't that hard. You use ROS which can be really powerful, but confusing to get a hold of. However, seeing your car complete it's first lap around the track with no human controlling makes it all worth it"

You learn a lot from class, but are not really expected to learn everything as long as you gain a brief understanding of the psets/final in class. There is some grind, but there are no tests, and the 3 psets + final are extremely manageable as long as you make some effort to have enough time to grind it on the last two days before its due, or slowly inch yourself to a finalized result.  Plus, all the pset questions feel like cool mini-projects (your own image denoising algorithm) while learning the fundamentals of ML! Also, our TA Tonmoy was amazing!"

It's very easy to get a good grade in this class by just copying the solutions but I would advise against doing this blindly. A lot of the joy of taking this class is understanding the algorithms and taking the time to soak it all in. Conceptually, RL can be hard to follow as there are tons of symbols and it's easy to forget what they all mean. Taking the time to read the textbook can often make lectures a lot clearer."

Prof. Meng is definitely THE BEST NLP professor and everyone seems to agree – he's extremely knowledgeable, and teaches cutting-edge information in the field with his research based approach. I really enjoy the research layout he did w/ guest speakers and paper presentations.  The paper presentation was very useful and gives a thorough understanding of whatever niche of NLP you use, and personally it helped me better read/deep-read the rest of the papers in the course. Also, NLP is constantly changing and the only way to get ahead is by reading current research.

After a few lectures only about 1/3 of the class shows up to lecture. Admittedly, professor Qi is a really dry lecturer and I couldn't bring myself to pay attention in the class. You can get most of the content just from reading the slides, which are posted online (along with the syllabus, just google the course name). The homeworks are really fun. Each homework covers an overarching topic (e.g. regression - normal equation, GD, SGD, neural networks, SVM, etc.). The homeworks are a mix of coding and \"sample exam questions\" which are concept questions about the topic in the homework. She gives a lot of opportunities to get extra credit on the homeworks and she extends the deadline for most homeworks cause she's really nice. For example one of the homework assignments was classifying some labels in a data set using a neural network. She made the homework \"competition style\" where the top 20 submissions get extra credit.\nThe tests are trivial (one midterm and one final); they are similar in style to CS 2110/easy CS elective tests. No coding on the tests, it's basically all understanding concepts and explaining how things work.\nOverall would recommend this class! One of my favorite CS electives so far."

The assignments are the thing I had the most trouble with in this course, as we're never actually taught how to do the code we need for the assignments. The instructions often were also unclear and just made it difficult to even get started with a question because you were unsure what it was asking for. Overall I think that some people might strive in this course, but it was not for me.

She has never asked us to do things that are impossible and usually are very reasonable with things if you do talk to her.3.

You don't need to be well versed, as long as you do show up and not zone out the home time you should be good! Attendance is not required but I think it's quite crucial to understand the material. Quizzes are a mix of some easy copy pasta from the lecture slides and a few questions that requires deeper level understanding but overall they are very doable.5. Just one late note, it would be better that people taking this course has a little of networks/cybersecurity/privacy/ML background. I didn't take anything like that before this but I had some personal interest in them so I understand some info faster.

One was data analysis for smart TVs (pretty easy), one was exploring Tor circuits (a little harder but nothing crazy), and one was performing a correlation attack (hard but not impossible). There was then a final project where you could explore anything related to privacy alone or with a group, it just needed to have some coding component. There were also periodic pop quizzes that were mostly graded on completion (ie served more of an attendance-taking role). My one complaint was that there was no rigorous assessment of lecture material, which made it all-too-easy to zone out in lecture and not need to review the material later.

Attendance is required for this class and we had 2 reading quizzes during the semester (on Bitcoin and Ethereum whitepapers), but if you fill out an excused absence form beforehand, he’s pretty lenient. Assignments are on a weekly basis, and I could usually get them done the day they were due.

The course reminds me a lot of Bloomfield's 2150 in a good way — interesting lectures and rigorous but meaningful weekly assignments. Some of the lectures are a bit more theoretical and math-y for my tastes (some topics like the math behind ECDSA and zk-SNARKs mostly went over my head), but most of the homework assignments are very practical and shockingly well-designed for a course that has never been offered before.There were some growing pains from this being a new course, including waits for assignment grading and regrade requests, but Bloomfield is very receptive to feedback and eventually did get everything handled. Also he made the final optional, which is nice. I'm sure that this course will only get better in the future, and hope it becomes permanently offered.

Although his lectures can be boring or dry, the content is actually pretty interesting so a lot of people end up skipping lectures and reading slides at home. He likes to share articles about some of the latest tech and research in the field. You can tell he's pretty passioned about the subject. Grading isn't super hard, and Arduino turns out not to be too hard to learn. The most difficult part of the class is probably trying to finish lab work during lab and maybe the midterm."

I took engineering interactive technologies with him and it was a really engaging class (that says a lot considering I wouldn't call myself a very techie person). I took this class because I am interested in HCI but the only experience I've had so far in this field is with mobile and desktop interfaces. This class widened my perspective of what it meant to interact with technology. This class focuses on the basics of building interactive technologies with sensors, Arduino, and different fabrication methods. I wouldn't be discouraged if you have no had experience, because I definitely didn't yet the course was still easy to follow, assignments are doable, and the professor is super accommodating and willing to help if you reach out. Workload is not too bad, most of the lab work can be done in class time. When we had assignments or homework, that only took max 3 hours a week out of class, most of the time it was closer to 1-2 hours. He really likes going into the history of technology and different types of interaction, which is cool because the CS department doesn't talk about that a lot, of course, it's not always the most exciting but nice to know about. Overall I would highly recommend this class if you want something interesting and has a low workload. #tCFspring2021"

As the final project, you build an interactive technology from scratch which is so unique. There's only at home quizzes and no exams."

There's a semester-long project you work on which helps you apply the concepts you learned to real-world applications. Prof. Apostolellis knows a lot about the industry and is truly a great professor. He responded well to our suggestions on improving the class. This was honestly one of my favorite classes I've taken at UVA so far. #tCF2020"

The beginning was very frustrating, as the blogs took me 5-10 hours to do per week, and I wasn't even sure if they were acceptable examples by his standard. He was very knit-picky about them and just uptight in general. He's very resistant to feedback and almost takes offense to it. On top of that, the quizzes were very subjective and I had trouble with them. Beware, this class might take you waaay more than 10 hours a week, and he. doesn't. care. He even said so in an email: \"My job is not to make your lives easy. My job is to help you learn. And learning takes time and effort. ... I fully understand the discomfort of working for 10 hrs and still not coming up with a satisfactory set of examples. This is intentional ... there's no other way around it.\"\nAfter the first few weeks though, he loosened up a bit and the class was more enjoyable. The homeworks and assignments were so much fun! He's a really nice professor if you get to know him. You learn really useful things, like usability guidelines, how to conduct user tests without bias, how to make design tradeoffs and consider context, how to ideate and make design artifacts, and the like. Lectures are fascinating, especially the first half when he goes over the cognitive and psychological stuff. If you're into design, this class is one of the only ones that you'll get the opportunity at UVA to learn about it and practice it, so if this is what you're interested in, definitely take the class! The knowledge I gained was worth it, but just beware that it may take a lot more time out of your week than a 3 credit class."

They were assigned roughly once a week, with the occasional off-week. The problems are insane, requiring logic and math that would take a single person an entire semester to solve.20% In-Class Activities: These were decent, but honest mistakes cost me dearly on some of them.20% Midterm: Basically a homework assignment, but you have to work on it alone, and you have 2.5 hours to do it. In short, this is where you will lose most of your points. Bring tissues.10% Project: The professor is ridiculously unclear about what he wants from us, wish me luck.\nThe Professor: Pretty bad. He \"teaches\" us by going over his course notes, which is a horrific way to teach a mathematical statistics class, thus rendering the class worthless and boring. He forces us to go to said worthless and boring lectures by giving out participation assignments, which just makes me not like this class even more. He also doesn't seem to recognize the difficulty of this class. For example, one particularly difficult homework got people complaining to him, and his response was \"I thought it was pretty easy.\" He's also condescending, as he mocked the classwork of the class before us. I mean, who does that, let alone a professor?\nWhat you should know: don't take this class if you don't have to. If you do, find a study group oml I would have withdrawn if I didn't find one. Also, you should know probability very well, and I recommend having taken a mathematical statistics class and a linear algebra class beforehand. Good luck :)\n#tCFfall2021"

Coming into this you're going to need to be pretty comfortable with linear algebra and especially probability, and having taken a mathematical statistics class like STAT 3120 is probably helpful as well (although less necessary). I largely enjoyed the course but my main criticism of it would be that lacked practical application and contextualization for a lot of the material; I do personally think understanding the theory is cool in and of itself though.\nThe class is difficult (I'd say comparable to a 4000 or certain 3000s MATH course), there's no getting around that, but it never felt unreasonably so. The TA and professor were helpful on piazza + office hours (and I strongly recommend using both, would not have gotten through the class without those). The midterm (which was the only exam) everyone basically failed, but he gave us reasonable test corrections and extra credit opportunities to make up for it. The psets are pretty time-consuming but doable, generally all of the solutions derive from the notes if you read carefully enough - get a study group too, super useful.\nThe lectures closely follow his notes (published on his website online which you can check out before taking the course), and are very very thorough. I'd recommend reading the notes before the lecture and using the lecture as a way to clarify. The in-class activities aren't bad at all, just stay on top of things and ask questions if you're confused before getting to class."

There are a couple of hands on group projects with smart watches that relate to machine learning. However, it seems more like using the helper code to build the model and did not apply anything that we learned in class. There was hardly any programming and the programming we did do was for data processing which is unrelated to the course content. Nevertheless, the class doesn't have much work and it's not hard to get an A.

This doesn't end up mattering though because none of the 3 projects we did really require a deep understanding of the math - you just implement an algorithm generally. None of them are particularly difficult (if you start early enough -  tonnn of time per) , although a working knowledge of Python + Pandas is pretty useful; if you know how to code but don't know either of those in particular you could reasonably learn what you need for the class via Google.\nThe econ part is pretty easy to pick up in the class; I knew 0 econ coming into the class but it's all explained pretty well and is pretty cool! My main criticism of the class is that most of the topics covered are something you can dedicate an entire class to so you never get super in-depth with anything - the intent of the course is very much to be an overview more than anything.\n#tCFspring2022"

However, I was interested in Web programming, so I took it anyway. You have four programming assignments you need to do, and you have to do your programming demo with T.A. and I feel like your grade somewhat depends on how strict your T.A. grades based on Rubric. First assignment is actually way more tedious than the rest of three because you have to only use PHP to do your assignment, whereas jquery and ajax can make your life easier later. This class is notorious for having a really long exams... and I am not sure how Professor Soffa will go about this next semester, but she lets us use the code handouts. Just a warning. STUDY before you go take the exam. You actually will not have enough time to go over the code handout and finish the exam. I personally think Professor Soffa is not a harsh grader, but two exams do worth a lot, so make sure to read over the powerpoint slides thoroughly.  You do learn a lot of different web programming languages, but it is more like self teaching, and lectures are not really engaging, but you do have in-class assignment every week that counts towards your grade each week. It is not a wide idea to miss a class in my opinion. Also, extra credits for each programming assignment are not that hard to do, so it is always better to do. Late penalty is quite harsh since you are losing 15 %, so think well before you decide to turn something late.  No groupwork unless you want to work with someone else for in-class assignments. I didn't get a textbook and I personally think it is not necessary for this class."

Just don't leave things to the last minute because they progressively get longer and may take longer than you expect. The tests and quizzes are open note, which is nice.

He's also very approachable and friendly and modifies the course goals based on feedback from students, which is awesome! Just as a note, I took this course with around 14 other students, so course dynamics might change a little with more students in the class.Syllabus is on github if you are interested: https://github.com/thomaspinckney3/cs4501"

In general, Pinckney expects a lot of class participation so he really doesn't downplay any questions. Sometimes he won't continue lecturing until someone asks a question lol. The material is very relevant to software companies today. You get a good idea of some strategies, ideas, and a lot of basic knowledge (but not really covered in classes) on both technical and non-technical concepts used in the real world. The projects are pretty tough, especially in the beginning and if you have no background knowledge in the tools used, but I think the projects are pretty worthwhile. The material covered in class is tightly-coupled with the projects which is nice. They are done in groups of 2/3, but it is still a good amount of work since the projects are due every 2 weeks. Great class, I honestly wished I had listened more in class at times."

Overall, I feel like I learned a little conceptually about network security, but not as much as I would've liked.

There's 8 total assignments, 2 exams, and the final OWL. Firstly Davidson actually gets into the roleplay of the class since I think it was him who actually pitched the name way back when. He's a pretty chill dude and he goes off a lot of tangents and loves to tell stories. I'm not like one of these tryhards that's like 'I wanted to learn more grrrr,' but I can completely understand where they're coming from. I really like cybersecurity so I just enjoy the course teachings, but I think objectively he didn't teach concepts well. The OWL was similar to intro to cyber CTF, but instead of CTF it was hack/break/alter an exe file. One thing that made a lot of people mess up is that for all the assignments you will be using a Jammy VM which is like Ubuntu 22.04, but Davidson hasn't changed the final since 2022 so you have to go make a new VM on Bionic which is Ubuntu 18.something before you start the OWL or else it is literally impossible for one of the challenges--which he basically never told us btw. But overall I thought the class was overall chill, a lot of reverse engineering which kinda sucks if you don't like reading x86 or assembly, but you learn quickly in cyber that everything all falls back to C and then breaking down the C code so its only inevitable. I recommend the course it wasn't too stressful and if you like Cyber then you'll like this"

            "text": "A fairly enjoyable elective covering malware, application security, web security, and forensics with a dash of network security at the very end. Intro to Cyber is required and necessary to have; CSO1 is also required and comes in very handy (especially the assembly and reverse engineering sections). CSO2 is helpful to have to get a better understanding of Linux (process management, memory regions and protections, etc.)\nLectures were clear, but moved quite slowly. I feel like we could have covered more material had Prof. Hassan moved quicker through lecture topics. Many homeworks had special lecture slides prepared that discussed relevant concepts in more detail and provided helpful hints. However, at least for the web security homework, there was a significant gap in what the self-study slides presented and what the full scope of necessary information was. These are slight complaints, though; Prof. Hassan was great overall and both him and the TAs were very helpful.\nOur homeworks were:* Setting up a Linux VM, plus an intro to reverse engineering* Injecting virus code into a Linux executable. One of the most difficult homeworks. I spent easily ~20-25 hours scouring the x86 manuals and looking at byte encodings to get it to work.* Crafting a buffer overflow exploit and a format string vulnerability exploit. Continues the theme of hardcore reverse-engineering from the previous homework.* A return-oriented programming (ROP) and obfuscation homework, which is somewhat easier than the previous ones.* Web security exercises (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection). Very useful and fun to crack, but requiring a lot of time spent googling and in OH since lectures leave a lot of gaps to be filled in.* Forensic analysis. Probably the second-hardest homework after the virus homework, with the file carving/file recovery portion especially difficult.\nThe most difficult homeworks will depend on your interests. If you don't like assembly, for instance, the reverse engineering homeworks in the first half of the semester will be less enjoyable. If you like web, you'll have a leg up for the web security homework when you need to deal with HTML and JavaScript. If you have experience with Linux system administration, the forensics homeworks are likely to be at least a little bit easier for you. Personally, I found the virus, web security, and forensics homeworks the hardest, but probably enjoyed the virus and web security homeworks the most.\nWe also had multiple choice quizzes about once every two to three weeks. Since the lecture slides are so clear, studying those are a great way to do well on the quizzes. The lowest quiz is dropped, which helps if you're having a rough week and either miss a quiz or do badly on one.\nThe lowlight of this class was probably the exams. There is one midterm and one final each worth 25% of your final grade. Class averages on these were comparable to averages on CSO exams but worth way more, so you can't really bank on a high homework and quiz average to offset the exam grades. Nonetheless, you are allowed one cheat sheet for both, which helps somewhat.\nOverall, this was a pretty doable class (workload is maybe about halfway between Orebaugh's Intro to Cyber and CSO2) even when taking it with harder classes. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to get more low-level cybersecurity experience after taking intro. If you enjoyed CSO, you'll enjoy this class. As with most CS classes, though, OH is a must."

Most of the homeworks are frustrating rather than thought-provoking.\nDavidson lectures right off of the slides, so the attention level in class is pretty low. Also, his tests are directly from the slides, so study hard the night before and memorize a ton and you'll be okay.\nHe's also very, very evasive about the final exam which changed drastically during the last week of class. This ended up screwing over some people as he moved the exam forward with a week of warning. Frustrating, considering he could have told us he was considering this long before the last week of class.\nThere are probably better electives out there unless you think you want to pursue a job in computer security."

Professor Davidson's lectures are very dry and he does not do a good job making them engaging.\nProfessor Davidson did a terrible job laying out the structure of the course. We were told that the final exam would be replaced with a final project. However, on our second to last class, he informed us that we would have a final assignment in addition to a cumulative final exam, all of which were due before our scheduled final exam time (and all by the third day of exams). This is laziness on the part of Professor Davidson and is unacceptable. Finals are an extremely busy time for students and we deserve to know structural information like this about the class long before the last week of classes.\nHe is also overwhelmingly sexist. During the last week of classes he forced us to watch a movie that made a point to say that engineering, and computer science in particular, is for men and not a place for women. As a female computer science major I found this extremely offensive.\nThe material itself was very interesting, and Professor Davidson is extremely intelligent, but he did a terrible job teaching this class. Even with all of this, the class is still worthwhile and the assignments are interesting. Just don't get your hopes up for a good teacher.\nThere are three tests throughout the semester and you get to drop your lowest score. They get harder throughout the semester so definitely try to plan on dropping the third if possible. For the most part, the early tests are flat out regurgitation of memorized terms."

You spend some time going over the material, but a portion of the class is spent with Davidson telling a story about some virus or security flaw.\nThe material in class covers a decent number of topics, but they are usually all older viruses and/or types of buffer overflow attacks. I wish there was more material on newer viruses.\nThe class itself isn't too difficult. There are weekly homeworks that take a few hours to complete. Get really familiar with gdb, as it will definitely help you complete the homework faster. There are three in class tests, the lowest of which is dropped, and then there is a take home final exam.\nThe class not being too difficult has it drawbacks though. I got a 90+ in the class, and still received a B due to a lot of people getting 90+, so be sure to do well on the tests.\nI probably wouldn't recommend this class, unless you're really interesting in the subject matter, or want a fairly lightweight CS elective."

I think I would have liked this class if office hours were more available. Guy, our TA, didn't know how to do some of the assignments and was very slow at grading.Prof. Davidson also showed music videos at the beginning of class every class which was odd since it didn't have anything to do with cs. Most were just random musics videos, one had some young women making out with each other in it. Not sure why we were watching that."

I didn't go to class after she stopped taking attendance, and you probably don't really need to at all.  There were 5 homework assignments throughout the semester, which take up 70% of your grade.  There first two are especially challenging, but are doable with TA help.  They are also assigned really far in advance to your due date though, so you have ample time to work on them.  There are three in-class labs that happen throughout the semester, which go to your attendance grade (10%).  If you show up to these you'll get full credit.  She also takes attendance on one random day of class that goes towards this grade, which I mentioned earlier.  The final is take home and worth the remaining 20% of your grade, as was a bit longer than I expected but definitely still doable.\nTLDR: Easy elective to take, can learn a lot about info-sec if you really want to lol"

            "text": "This is an interesting class and professor to review. I have very mixed feelings about the class, and what you will take away from it will depend largely on you.\nAlright, let me get the negatives out of the way first: Tian is not a good lecturer, period. It is not that she doesn't try, but man, I really hate to say it but sometimes it is just hard to understand her. I hate to bring up a negative point that is really not her fault, but to give a fair review I have to mention it, because it was impossible for me to sit through an entire lecture without daydreaming or losing focus.  A typical lecture would go like this: show up, pay attention during announcements, pay attention for the first 10 minutes, get confused because you cannot understand 20% of the words being said, tune out the rest of class and code for another class or just browse the web. What is rather disappointing about this is that the material itself is really interesting, and a positive I can give Prof. Tian that I have seen as negatives for other professors is that much of the material is relevant even today. Of course, not all of it, but far more than past professors.\nAnother positive (or negative depending on your point of view) is the grading. My goodness, it is easy to grab an A. In my opinion, you would have to really, really not care to not get an A. There are 5 homeworks totalling 70% of your grade (14% each). Homeworks are 70% of the grade, and if you went through intro to cybersecurity, then these homeworks will be a breeze, minus maybe the first one, but even that isn't too ridiculous. There are 4 online, open-note quizzes and one of them is dropped (Those 3 quizzes only count for 10% of your grade). The difficulty of those quizzes depends on the TA who makes it. We've had one really easy one, one intermediate, and one ridiculously hard one so far. There is a final exam worth 15% of your grade, however I cannot speak to its difficulty because ours was cancelled due to COVID. But to give you an idea about how easy this class is, instead of simply scaling up the other portions of the class to calculate our grade, she GAVE EVERYONE THE 15% FOR FREE. I know, right?  That does not even account for the ridiculous amounts of extra credit you can collect: you can get up to 15% for participating in class, doing extra work on the homework assignments (which is usually honestly less work than the actual homework itself), and participating in optional labs. So, even if you don't pay attention in lecture and bomb the final, there is no excuse to not get at least a B+.\nFinally, to speak a bit more on the professor herself, Prof. Tian really, truly does care about her students -- it's very obvious. She is very kind and approachable, and I had no problems with her other than the lecture thing, which is not even her fault. Additionally, she is clearly very knowledgeable in cybersecurity -- we would be discussing relevant topics in mobile security where out of nowhere she would mention something like \"WE informed company X about this flaw.\" I haven't taken advantage of it yet, but I would imagine she is a great resource for any student interested in cyber-security.\nIn conclusion, here is what I meant when I said that what you will take away from it will depend largely on you. The material is there in the slides -- if you are a budding cybersecurity expert trying to learn as much as you can, and you have to motivation to try and sit through the lectures (or better yet, I've found doing indepedent research on the material on youtube or google to be more efficient and useful), you will learn a lot of cool stuff. But, if you are looking for a class to take to fill out your last CS elective, and you don't give one iota about cyber security, you will not learn much. Since the grading is so easy (I believe her first semester teaching it the average GPA was 3.94, and that was with all students taking the final!), there is little external motivation to learning the material. You need to have the internal motivation to do so. So, TLDR; here's my recommendation for 3 types of people:\n1. People like myself: Ones who like to learn cool, new things, but know you will be too lazy to do the extra work to do so if there is no external motivation: Don't take this class. You will end up doing the bear-minimum to scoop your A and move on, and you will empty inside knowing you didn't learn much.2. People interested in cyber security or those with high internal motivation to learn any material: Take this class. There is a lot here, and a lot of fascinating attacks that are still relevant. You will learn a lot AND have the added benefit of a free A.3. People who need an easy elective for whatever reason and won't feel guilty about doing the bear minimum: Take this class. It's a free B+ at minimum assuming you don't bomb the homeworks."

Defense isn't supposed to be a super difficult class... sure it's low leveled, but the intent is to introduce undergraduates to computer security in a fun way: Davidson's original objective when he created the course. With Bloomfield, I thought this class would be extra chill since 2150 was a ton of work... WRONG. This class was by far one of the least-chill classes I've ever taken. The assignments and exams were completely different from other instructors. Some of the assignments took upwards of 18 hours. The Obfuscation HW was extremely vague and could've been interpreted in so many ways. Some spent 15+ hours on it while others only spent 7 hours. It was just an utter waste of time. Bloomfield had to change parts of the assignment since it was literally impossible. (if you interpreted the assignment correctly) There was no clear objective of the assignment. The RSA homework was a nightmare. This is a 4000 level CS class... we shouldn't be doing busy work: we should be learning challenging material. Not only were the instructions very  unorganized, the RSA homework was busy work and nothing else. It didn't teach me anything about RSA; instead, it taught me how to follow directions and read binary files [which he changed to ascii since so many people couldn't complete it.... but guess who still did it with binary files :) ]. Students probably spent over 15 hours on that as well. The Hashing HW was also a complete waste of time. Why should I implement SHA-1 using C++? Not only is that reinventing the wheel, you're reinventing a broken wheel. (Google cracked SHA-1 like last semester) When I told my friend from CMU that we were implementing SHA-1, he laughed. Apparently his professors said \"never try to implement a hashing algorithm, it's a waste of your time. there are better ones written for you\" a couple days ago.  Debugging that was ridiculous too.... but partial credit was extremely generous.\nAlthough the buffer overflow and format string homeworks took a lot of time, they were actually interesting and taught us a lot about these vulnerabilities. I really wish we could've spent more time on other topics like ROP chains, Wireshark (packet sniffing), and more modern techniques. Instead, we just got ridiculous busy work that should not be given to experienced CS Majors. The exams were 2150 style and complete memorization; however, his grading guidelines were just awful for this class.... so it wasn't as easy as 2150 exams.\nOverall, Bloomfield is a chill guy and definitely knows his stuff. I still learned a lot from the course, but I think his curriculum isn't mature yet. The course average ended up being a 69%, but he pulled through with a 10 point curve. He's a chill guy, but I definitely think the course could've been better. We never got our OWL certificates and he never dressed up as Snape/Dumbledore. Take it with Davidson."

I originally found myself in the \"don't get it\" category, but I went to office hours and was able to ultimately understand it by the end of the course. If you come in understanding the main ideas, you will cruise as did many more experienced students. The whole course is essentially about modifying a previously compiled program to change it to do something else, either by writing a binary string as input or writing a virus in the code. There isn't much actual \"defense,\" it's really a hacking class that teaches you how to exploit a program. We had to sign an agreement at the beginning not to use what we had learned for malicious purposes. I would say overall it was a worthwhile class especially if you're interested in security or want to gain a deeper understanding of how your code works at a low level."

You also have almost weekly homework assignments, which take hours to complete, because you are also working on a semester-long project that you have. Being able to balance the homework assignments and the project is extremely difficult because they are both labor intensive. Also, the project is setup in a frustrating way given that they teach you HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and Angular (in that order), and they have you make the application in one language, then for the next project you do it in the next language, and so forth. This causes your project to change so much from what you already had intended, and sometimes the additions are simply just to check off boxes and get points. This class caused me so much stress this past semester, and I know that I am not the only student who feels this way.

I also found the exams really tough, asking extremely niche questions like \"How do you split a page to make a certain layout in Bootstrap?\" (I don't understand the purpose of having an exam on questions like this). The average for the midterm was around 65% so it seems like an oversight on the professor's part. Despite this, you learn a lot and if you aren't self-motivated to make stuff for your portfolio this class definitely pushes you in the right direction.

I'd also say the tests so far have been pretty fair game and Prof Hott also curves depending on how the class does. All in all, I think this class is a great way to really force yourself to actually learn languages like PHP and CSS and probably even some frameworks like Bootstrap and Angular. Also, at the end of the class you basically have a full stack  project (you work with one other student on) to put on your resume (+ handful of languages) !"

I would not start your project assignment submissions a day or two before it is due (although you can do this for the first two assignments and it would be fine). I would attend lecture just to make taking the in-class quizzes easier as it's based on what is taught in lecture. I would recommend this course as a fun and easy CS elective. Upsorn is also just a nice teacher who really cares about her students and how they are learning. If anything, I would take any course with her just because she is teaching it. My only problem with the course is that it teaches you a wide range of webdev tools but none in a lot of depth. However due to the nature of the course, Upsorn only teaches enough to introduce the tools (AJAX, Angular, HTML, CSS) so that you can go off on your own and explore it. This is most likely due to not having enough time more in depth. If you are expecting to learn all these tools in depth, then that is not what you will get. If you want to learn about basic web dev, then this is the right course for you."

Start HWs and sprints earlierish because they can take time (up to 15 hours for some if inexperienced). Dont enroll expecting lightwork or an easy class from previous reviews.

I found it hard to stay engaged throughout the whole time, particularly since sometimes it felt like the lecture began with super easy content and ended with stuff over my head. There was an attendance policy where she would take attendance on random days and you had to be there for at least five of the days she took attendance (this was annoying, hopefully it will change in future semesters). The five homeworks were a mix of written questions and coding. They weren't too difficult but took some time because of the so-so lecture quality. The take-home midterm exam was pretty hard, mainly because our homeworks had not been graded and we had no other practice problems. Thankfully there was not a final exam. The final project was a group project where you had to do something related to AI, code, and social good. It was pretty easy, especially if you're group doesn't wait til the last minute. The course content was a good survey of classic AI methods, modern ML/NN/LLM stuff, AI applications, and AI ethics. I'd probably recommend taking AI with a different professor but I would also say it's worth going to a few lectures because Professor Kuo could improve as she continues to teach. #tCFS24"

The one midterm was brutal for a lot of the students if I remember correctly. I'm pretty sure it was all fair game though, just that a lot of the people didn't have real solid understandings of the topics. After the midterm, there was a massive drop in lecture attendance because you're never tested on the remaining content, all you really need to do is the final project.Chat is pretty capable of most of the coding assignments, but awful at the weekly quizzes.You'll do fine on the quizzes if you just review the slides for like 15 minutes.Overall solid course, would recommend if you're interested in AI!Wish there was a slightly stronger emphasis on the importance of AI safety and maybe even a mention of current policy and governance. Granted, it is more of an introductory AI course."

With that being said, the course was probably 10x easier with this guy because of that. I was getting like 100s on all the projects and homeworks (which once again you could resubmit for basically an A) and then for the final project where I had to make some AI thing of my choice with a group, I had room for failure to literally get a score as low as a 70 on the project and still end with an A (not that they graded as harsh to give a 70). I actually preferred this structure of the class because it allowed students like me to learn from their mistakes when doing the homeworks, which was greatly appreciated. The content itself is a lot of math actually, but not difficult math. If you've taken a probability class before, it shouldn't be too bad, because half the time you're doing basic probability problems. The one thing that was really annoying about this class though is that for the final project where you make an AI project of your own, you have to write a 1 page pitch of your project, then present that pitch with your progress on it in class, develop the project, create another slides presentation, film a video of your group presenting your final project, and then write a 5-10 page paper on your project--all very tedious and unnecessary in my opinion, as we could've just done a project proposal + project development + presentation. Also attendance is graded...All in all though, the professor is pretty chill in terms of his class structure and is actually a really great teacher if you listen to lecture. Like I said, I was in the other AI class before, and when I was in that class, I had a really hard time understanding what was being taught. When I switched to this professor, everything made a lot of sense and he's really good at breaking the concepts down and then building them up."

            "text": "TLDR: The content of this course is interesting and covers a groundbreaking field. However, this course was the most unstructured course I have taken here at UVA.\nMy review of this course will consist of discussing two different parts: the course and the professor. First, the course has some interesting content that can be applied to real life. Some of these topics included reinforcement learning, transformers (which is what Chat GPT is), Markov models, neural networks, and much more. Contrary to what previous reviews said, there wasn’t as much coding in this course. Furthermore, the structure of the course when I took it highly differed from the reviews of those in the past. Thus, when reading the reviews of this course, take them with a grain of salt since the course can change from semester to semester. Grading was broken into the following: 55% for homework assignments, 20% for midterm (which by the way, was extremely hard but they graded it generously), 20% for final project, and 5% for attendance. This course itself was not difficult and I found it not hard to get an A.\nMoving onto my review of the professor I had when taking this course: Yangfeng Ji. He taught this course with a PhD student, Stephanie Schoch. First, the lectures were boring since they read straight off the slides. Moreover, sometimes the lecture slides had very complicated formulas and concepts that were not explained well but later showed up on homework assignments and the midterm. Second, the professors and TAs had horrible response times. Professor Ji emphasized to never email him unless it was an emergency, which I understand. He told us to only post questions or personal matters on Piazza. There were many times when students had questions about homework assignments that were posted on Piazza days to a couple of weeks before they were due and the questions were not responded to until after the assignment was due or hours before it was due. I would say that 25% of Piazza posts were never actually responded to, 50% of posts took around a week to be responded to, and the other 25% of posts were responded to within days. Third, Professor Ji and Stephanie sometimes did not show up to their office hours. Professor Ji held his on Fridays at 9 AM. There was one week when I had an emergency and needed to talk to Professor Ji. I figured going to his office hours was best since they don’t ever respond to emails to Piazza posts. I woke up that day and went to his office hours. He never showed up and sent out an announcement at 9:40 AM that he couldn’t make it. There was this other time I attended Stephanie’s office hours and she never showed up or sent out an announcement. I found these two instances to be highly inconvenient to us students. Fourth, the professors and TAs did a horrible job at grading the assignments throughout the entire semester. The first two homework assignments took around a month to be graded and returned to us. What makes it worse is that all the content that was covered in these two homework assignments was put on the midterm. Since we didn’t get the results from the homework by the time of the midterm, a lot of us really struggled on the exam. Subsequently, the midterm was not graded until another month as well. The last couple of homeworks were posted at the end of the semester so they had to be returned to us in a timely manner. As for the final project, we had final project proposals that were supposed to be graded and provided to us for feedback well before the final project was due. However, the professors and TAs took so long to grade them so my group was struggling to see if we were on the right path or not. Fifth, the posting of the homeworks was horribly planned. The syllabus at the beginning of the semester mentioned that we’ll have five homework assignments throughout the semester; note that each one was typically difficult, tedious, and time-consuming. The professors posted the last two homeworks within the last two weeks of the semester. Having these assignments on top of the final project during finals weeks made it so much worse.\nOverall, I thought that I would enjoy this class but found it to be one of the worst CS classes I’ve ever taken. I would recommend other CS electives where you can actually learn the material on a fair basis.\n#tCFS24"

Take home midterms.\nCons: Slides are very example light. Lots of variables in the notes. Midterms can be tricky. Homework sometimes is very hard. Homeworks prepare you for nothing on the midterms and later in the semester feel less AI than some of the earlier topics.\nSomething to note as well: This is the first time Floryan taught this class so while we kept on track lecture wise, the homeworks suffered."

He's super approachable, and is really helpful during office hours.  His lecture style is pretty laid back and engaging.  Class discussions were a fairly large part of this course, so certainly go to class.\nRegarding the course content: We start with Expert Systems, then move to Local Search/Path Planning, and wrap up with reasoning under uncertainty and machine learning.  There were four homework assignments and four takehome, open-book exams.\nThe homeworks were fairly easy (I spent not much more than ~5 hours on each; perhaps more for the first).  Each had a window of about 2 weeks to complete.  There's one for each major topic of the course; I've heard he may add another, which would *not* be a big burden at all.\nThe takehome tests were also really easy.  He cancelled class on those days and held office hours instead; if you go to his (crowded) office at that time, he's really helpful in answering any questions you may have about the tests.  No, he doesn't give you the answer, but he's more helpful than most professors are.\nSome people mentioned grading issues; I'm tempted to think that this is because they either didn't pay attention to his last-minute modifications during class, or because they didn't read the assignment document thoroughly--I never lost a point on the homeworks.  He holds office hours; I'd recommend hanging out even if you don't have exact questions.  Some of the best help I received was when other students asked questions and I listened in to his answers.\nYes, the class was a bit disorganized this semester--the assignments were constructed \"on the fly,\" and many important decisions were made offhand and in-class.  That, however, should be resolved by next semester, now that Floryan knows what he's going to cover/assign."

The subject matter was interesting and Professor Floryan is great at explaining complex concepts and answering students' questions. The most difficult part of the course for me was the homework. Due to the fact that I took this course over the Summer there was little to no downtime between assignments  and some would be due 3 days after they were released. It is crucial that you start early, get help from a TA or Floryan if necessary and choose a good partner. I worked without a partner but if you are able to find someone that will work equally hard and is at a similar skill level, your life will be a lot easier. Some parts of tests were quite difficult but fair given you were well prepared. Highly recommend the class but be prepared because it won't be easy."

I was sincerely impressed by the kind of community that was built in the class for it being fully online. During lectures the Zoom chat would be buzzing both about class material and going off on fun tangents from the material, and Floryan would engage with all of it which I thought was super cool.\nThe homeworks were not the easiest but they were super fun, especially the second half. HW3 involved writing an algorithm that would play Ticket To Ride (the board game) and everyone who wanted could enter their bot into a class-wide bracket. We got to watch the final round of the bracket live on the last day of class and cheer on the bots while the owners explained their algorithms which was a really great way to end the semester.\nThere were probably a few hiccups with the grading system, in particular the quizzes could feel a little subjective, and you needed to pass each quiz to some extent to get a good grade (each quiz/hw corresponded to one of nine modules and you were graded based on how many modules you passed). Overall there were plenty of retake opportunities (HWs could be resubmitted as many times as you want even after you received feedback) and the TAs were really good about keeping up with grading.\nIf you're looking for a fun and interesting CS elective I would highly recommend this class!"

Also, I highly recommend taking this course with 2 friends you can trust as the homework can be difficult to manage by oneself. However, Frenor is nice and does send lots of useful emails. I would highly recommend taking the course as the topic is interesting and prof is nice, even if everyone except Freenor gets confused at around halfway of most lectures.  The homeworks were also quite unique as he pits everyone's AI against one another and your grade  is depended on the score. Since there is some randomness involved in the testings, so long as your AI works to some degree, you will be give at minimum a 90 for an assignment, thought those who get around the top percentile do get extra credit. If there was ever a class I was forced to retake, I would make it this class. Freenor does bring up many interesting topics in class , but you do have to pay attention or you get lost VERY fast."

The prereqs were not sufficient for the material (very prob/stat heavy) so you'll probably do a lot of outside reading. The material taught is very theory-heavy as AI requires, but most students come into the class not expecting that at all. Assignments are interesting but difficult because the lectures aren't enough to get by. You go from very abstract concepts to assignments like implementing a connect four game with infinite rows.\nFreenor is nice and knowledgeable, but he is new to teaching and very clearly lacks the ability to clearly explain lecture content. Lectures basically involved Freenor copying his prepared notes onto the chalkboard (which was usually illegible), and failing to answer most questions. Attendance was close to 30% towards the end of the semester. Everyone in office hours was confused and the graduate TAs were not always the most helpful and didn't always know what the assignment was for that week.\nThe midterm was straight up a joke (and he cancelled the final, btw). It was worth three points and although I didn't think I did particularly well, I got a 100. So did a lot of people apparently -- the grading is very lenient. Basically, you'll likely come out of this class with an A but you'll have no idea what you're doing the entire time and will fudge your way through the assignments. The final grades seemed to be randomly assigned, especially since ALL the assignments were groupwork and my partner and I had identical scores for the midterm... but she got an A+ and I only got an A even though I pulled most of the grunt work.\nBiggest waste of a class. Yes, you'll get an \"easy\" A if that's what you're looking for, but you'll actually have to put a lot of effort getting your assignments done for this class, and you'll come out with next to no knowledge about AI.

            "text": "Do not take this class if you do not know JavaScript, JSX, ReactNative, or expo because you will not learn it from him and it's difficult to find resources to help you. Do NOT take any class ever with Daniel Graham even if he changes this class, do NOT take it.\nDaniel Graham is a nice guy, but he can't teach. You can tell he really likes what he teaches and knows a lot, but he's not good at relaying this information. He has no organizational skills. He doesn't have a real/concrete syllabus and frequently changes projects. For example, he gave us this in class assignment (in class assignments are nowhere to be found in the grade breakdown). Within 12 hours of it being due, he changed it to be called \"Project 1\" and made it 5% of our grade.\nThere are no assignments for this class so we don't have the opportunity to actually implement what we learn in class. His lectures are awful. He \"live codes\" which is just a disaster. Every class he runs into bugs and it takes him 30 minutes to debug it  (lectures are 50 minutes long). Then we just watch him try to debug his code so no one knows what he's actually trying to do. Most of his lectures are him trying to debug his code and apologizing for the bad lecture. He gets really flustered when this happens it's uncomfortable. He's a new professor which is quite evident from his lectures. He posts his code from lecture, but it's undocumented so I never know what anything is actually doing. He also uses new technology (expo, sketch) randomly in class and doesn't tell you to download it ahead of time so it's easy to get lost in lecture when you're trying to download software and follow along. If you run into an error, he will basically just tell you to google it.\nHe taught all of the material really quickly like within the first half of the semester. In class, he said he's going to get a bunch of guest lecturers...but according to the schedule we still have more material to cover? Very confusing.\nHe's extremely unclear about literally everything, especially due dates. We have this semester long project that's supposed to be due at the end of the semester, but no one knows if it's due at the end of the semester or 4/4 because that's the last checkin day. Also, he set up weekly checkins which were originally optional, but now they aren't? He gave us an in class coding exam in which we were to build a ReactNative app in 50 minutes. We don't have assignments, so it's pretty difficult to do something in 50 minutes that you've never done before. In the exam, we had to call an API, but it crashed because everyone was calling it at the same time. Everyone immediately emailed him after the exam (he was in Prague...) and his solution to remedy the situation was to give us 30 more minutes. The API still wasn't working.\nHe has 4 office hours a week for ALL of his classes so you basically just wait in line after all of the Algo students and by then his office hours are over. He hardly responds to piazza posts which are mostly students just wanting to know what the assignment is, the grade breakdown, or when the project is due. He has 2 TAs that don't have office hours and don't have anything to grade because there are no assignments, so I'm not really sure what they do besides show us video tutorials when Daniel Graham is not there.\nMobileApp used to be one of the most popular electives in the CS department when Sherriff was teaching it. This class at the beginning had a waitlist of like 80 people and now there are 10 spots open. I wouldn't take this or any class with Daniel Graham ever again. I took comp arch when Graham co taught with Reiss, and he was bad then too, but at least he had Reiss to save him them."

The assignments ranged from being easy to really difficult and this was really frustrating because I never knew what to expect.

The reviews about Graham aren't incorrect - he's definitely a bit unorganized and it shows in the class. That being said, his intentions are still very good and he's absolutely willing to help you succeed if you reach out. The entire course was taught online (besides exams) through pre-recorded videos - I personally enjoyed this since I could selectively watch lectures based on prior knowledge, but this may not be best for everyone. Assignment descriptions can be a bit vague and typo-ridden. The TA on Piazza was a blessing and definitely clarified a lot of confusion throughout the course.\nIf you're a self-driven student looking to go into software engineering who is willing to put the time into learning the content, I would definitely recommend this class. React Native is rising quickly in popularity and learning React (the web equivalent) will be very simple after this course - both are very good tools to know for real-world SWE jobs. The course also covers other cool tools like Firebase and Figma."

Like multi-threading, action-oriented programming, and GUI design are just easy as pie.\nWhile I think the subject matter of this class is worth it, I will say that you should not take this too seriously grade-wise.

There were some quizzes, but due to the large size of the class and limited TA staff, those never got graded. The midterms are easy IF you study A LOT for them and take notes in class. Don't just scan through the lectures- make a study guide, review the slides and re-listen to his recordings. His lectures were great in my opinion. I usually sat in the back and I could see half the class not paying attention, but he's actually a really engaging lecturer and makes a lot of jokes.\nYou have to self-teach most of the way for both the web and mobile projects. He'll give you basic examples in class and if he thinks a part of it requires a lot of steps or something that can't be googled easily, he'll walk you through. The Web project wasn't bad (PHP, CSS, and HTML are super easy to learn), just follow directions and put some effort in to make your website look nice.\nFor the mobile project, we had to set up a raspberry pi and ran into soooo many issues with it. But going to Sherriff's office hours helped a ton. Some people thought it was unfair he made us learn Android so quickly, but he honestly gave us a fair amount of time for us to learn it. All those milestones are there for a reason, implement each part of the app when they're due. Most of the stuff (asynchronous threading, connecting the app to a third-party app like facebook or twitter) took a LOT of googling and experimenting and frustration (3-4 hours max) but less than 10 minutes to implement once we figured out what to do. The only hard part was creating a nice GUI - Android Studio's design software was not very user-friendly, but he counted functionality way more than design in the end since there are just too many other things we had to have working. Overall, one of the most useful classes I've taken in college."

Assignments required PHP as the back end language, whereas we only touched on Node.js briefly. Given that development today is usually done with back end languages such as Ruby, Python, or Node, I'm not sure why we didn't go into further detail on those subjects.

The final could be completed at home over a period of time, and it was open book and open notes.

The projects take some time but really don't teach you much that a quick youtube tutorial couldn't.Overall, easy class with projects take some time; but lectures never felt that useful and gave the impression they were put together 30 minutes before class.

It was my first time taking a class of his and his enthusiasm for the material he teaches makes the class more interesting and engaging, and he's also funny and a nice person. Towards the beginning of the semester there were 2 or 3 classes dedicated just to Kotlin coding, and at this point I thought I wouldn't like the class because it was confusing and hard to follow (to me, anyways.) But the class quickly expanded past that to topics like the history of mobile dev & languages, architecture, databases, and what makes good design. The content is pretty interesting, and Sherriff is good at explaining those concepts.\nYour grade consists of 3 projects (2 mini-apps, and 1 final project app), and 3 quizzes. We only had 2 quizzes due to the events of the semester, and in my opinion they were fair because the material comes directly from the class/ slides. Make sure you study though, because you do actually have to know the material. The final exam gives you an opportunity to make up any points you missed from the quizzes. The projects consisted of two mini bucketlist apps made in two different languages, and one final app of your choice in any language. The two mini apps you worked on alone, and for the final project you could work alone or with a partner. I personally struggled with the projects, especially the one in Kotlin, but the projects were the most valuable part of this course to me because I learned a lot while making them. I recommend starting each project early unless you are experienced with mobile dev/ react already.\nOverall, this has been my favorite course I've taken at UVA. I got into CS because I wanted to make games, apps, and websites, and I feel that this course put me on the right track to be able to achieve that. Thank you Sherriff!"

My enjoyment of this class was shockingly low given its premise (a literal college class on video games); sadly, though Prof. Hott was an overall good instructor (and a big reason why I took the course), the course design and structure made the difference and made for a staggering dearth of fun.\nProfessor Hott is very nice, approachable, and made the class an open, welcoming space to discuss video games. However, while lecture time often focused on interesting material (e.g., case studies in how video games implemented design principles), the bulk of our semester grade was focused on the games we actually designed, programmed, and built (both individually and in a larger team project at the end of the semester). The result was that lectures were quite disconnected from the bulk of what we were being graded on, which was frustrating. To make things worse, there were in-class activities that amounted to random attendance checks at various points in the semester, so your options were A) attend lecture and spend 50 minutes most days learning material that was interesting but not all that relevant to what you were actually being graded on; or B) skip lecture and potentially forfeit up to 5% of your semester grade.\nWe were also required to write two reports on games in the first half of the semester. These were required to be at least three pages, single-spaced. Since we were explicitly asked not to write a game review, however, these reports seemed to require doing outside research on the game and its context to get full points. While I scored decently well on these, a lot of my peers I took the class with seemed to find them frustrating, and I understand why. The rubric was rather vague, so the way I did well was by simply getting lucky on the first assignment and following the same template for the second. This is not a fair design for a learning activity.\nThe actual game projects in the class really didn't make up for this, and were in fact also quite frustrating. We had two individual projects in PICO-8 (a minimal framework sort of like writing a GameBoy game) and Unity. We spent a few classes going through the PICO-8 environment and even profiling some Lua code (which PICO-8 uses on the backend), but spent only one class going through a very basic Unity example (though this was also recorded as a demo for later reference). Unity can be extremely frustrating to use, so it was disheartening that we only spent one (1) lecture on an actual Unity example while spending many more lectures on material that was tangential to the game projects.\nBeing forced to go to lecture and feeling like I'm not actually learning helpful information is, admittedly, my least favorite college course structure and experience. On the bright side, I've heard that this course is significantly better with other instructors (e.g., Sherriff). If you're looking for a fun end-of-college elective like I was, don't take this class at all, or at least don't take it with Prof. Hott."

Would say this is my favorite CS elective here at UVA."

Exams can't be blown off, but they're nothing to worry about.  Sherriff is awesome; take this class!"

Prof. Sherriff covers some really interesting topics in game design, like balancing, AI, game physics, etc. The class doesn't follow the standard grading model: you get experience points for completing quests (assignments) and doing well on bosses (exams), which result in your final level (grade) for the semester. There isn't much coding until you are assigned to your 3-4 person group, where you all design a game on the caliber of a high quality flash game. This semester we all used MonoGame, a game engine in C#. You select the project that interests you the most at the pitch meeting. All of the games seemed to turn out well, but keep in mind that your project selection has a huge effect on your enjoyment of the class. I hear that Floryan is teaching this class in the future, which should be similarly great."

Sherriff makes sure this isn't a whatever class and students that stay in it learn more about games beyond 'they're fun!'. The group project is also incredibly fun to do and really a learning experience.\nHowever, if Sherriff tries to \"gamify\" the class, stay vigilant. Grading transparency is poor in this class. Additionally, the gamercard that keeps track of grades told everyone they had an entire letter grade higher than what they actually had and this wasn't corrected until /after/ the final. I'm still not sure how he's going to deal with that, because that's something that's not cool at all. Still, everything else in this class was worth it. Take it if you can."

He clearly loves teaching this topic, and you do get to make your own game.\nThe bad: Well, ok, some people might consider this a good because you learn a lot from it, but your game engine that you build is cumulative. That means if you screw up on an earlier lab, you can really pay for it with later labs. Also, lecture can kinda devolve into 2 things: People saying meaningless things to get participation points, and people saying things because they're passionate, but speaking for too long and preventing progress.\nThe ugly: The TAs likely don't have a grading standard they go by, and probably have little communication with Floryan. As a result, sometimes I received high scores when I shouldn't have, and sometimes people got low scores when they shouldn't have due to some small thing like files not being in the right directory.\nThe class is gamified, and it's awful. The site they use for it is buggy, and poorly designed and doesn't useful info until you click 2 levels down. You also don't know where your grade will stand until the very end of the semester. And, Floryan fails you automatically if you don't get a high enough score in 1 of the 3 categories, so you're essentially getting graded on your worst performances, not the average.\nOverall, if you're really really into game design and feel like you need to learn about this stuff to continue your career as an aspiring game dev, take this. Otherwise, if you're just looking for an easy stress-free elective, I recommend you don't take it."

            "text": "Tl;dr whole class was re-designed which kind of made it more interesting but also a lot harder; if you don't get great teammates...it's really going to suck for you lol. I think this would be a good course to those who are seeking to further their game development knowledge, but those who are new will struggle a bit more and will have to really  step up in order to do well.\nSo this semester, Floryan and his TAs redesigned this whole course so it's completely different from how it was structured in the past. Now, the class is divided into teams of max 9 people, who are then divided up into 3 subteams: Design, SFX/Level, and Engine, and as the names suggest, each team is responsible for the different aspects of their game. You code in SDL2, which is this really annoying development library lol (so many times....I really just wanted to use Unity :') ). You are only responsible for assignments pertaining to your specific team, however the grading system was also re-designed in a way such that your final grade is dependent on how well your teammates do on their assignments. I understand what Floryan was trying to go for when creating this system, but honestly it felt like getting a good grade (like above a C) would've been impossible (especially if you can't convince your teammates to do their work) and my GPA would have been crushed if all classes had not switched to Credit/No Credit for the semester. I also think that Floryan and the TAs were definitely very lenient when grading but also this class started off as having really high expectations. The first 2 assignments were the hardest assignments in the whole class imo.Even though, this is supposed to be a game design class, if you aren't on the Design team, you really don't get much exposure to game design other than the lectures, which were fun pre-COVID-19, but few lectures were dedicated to going over new topics in the assignments, so I think if you are on Level or Engine teams, expect to struggle a bit more, especially if you're new to game development.\nI do acknowledge that I might have more complaints about this class than others because I had a particularly bad experience with my team; basically my team was already short a few people when we started and on top of that, only like a couple of people were really motivated to work on the game towards the end, so I felt like I had to step up and try to do more, but it led to me burning out. I definitely learned a lot from this class (through my pain and tears lol) especially since I really wasn't familiar with game design or game dev prior to taking it, but when I found out that I had to do a lot more than I expected, the extra work ended up stressing me out a lot. So I can't genuinely encourage this class to someone who doesn't have strong coding skills and/or some familiarity with game development. However, if you are really interested in game design or game development and are willing to work at it, I would encourage you to try! Floryan is sympathetic if you reach out to him with your problems."

            "text": "The course got restructured this past semester so the professor and students were under the understanding that this course may have had problems in the structure of it.First of all, let's start with the positives, I liked and enjoyed this course. It was hard and stressful, but fun and rewarding. Lectures were interesting and fun (although online lectures after the online transition were not as fun as the teacher and student discussion in lecture were what made lecture fun). FYI, I am biased in the sense that I had a great team to work with.Second, let's talk about the structure problems of the course. I am sure these following problems will get remediated when Floryan teaches the course again, but the largest problem from the group assignment structure was that you weren't really building your game til the last 4 weeks of school as you are spending the time before it building all the tools that you need in order to code your game. Subteams (there are 3: design, sfx/level, and engine) were working pretty much working independently the entire semester until the last 3-4 weeks so a lot of problems stemmed from bad communication across teams about what the end product needed to look like, what was needed, etc. Another problem was that the course was frustrating due to the high expectations of the professor that led to the assignments being extremely hard. However, this is a 4000 level course, expect it to be challenging and hard. That's what it means to be in a 4000 level.If you are taking this course under this similar course structure, my advice is to make sure to be very communicative with your team members (full team and subteam wise) and to make sure to tell the professor and TAs if you run across team problems. In my personal opinion, I think this course is worthwhile to take. Even if you are not interested in game design, the aspect of working in this type of team structure is an experience worth taking. In my personal opinion, I think that the course is not difficult in that the content is hard to wrap your mind around, but rather mostly time consuming as you have to plan, code, and expect for setbacks throughout the semester. Expect to be spending a lot of time with your teammates. You will bond over your struggles."

Making games and learning about game engines was really cool!\nThe class has since been restructured for Fall 2020 and is taught with Unity! Would totally recommend this course to anyone who likes video games and wants some experience coding in Unity!"

Homeworks was reasonable but I have no idea how relevant they were to Cloud today because she never explained this, or she did but I didn't understand because all her explanations are hard to follow. Almost everyone in the class showed up because attendance (taken through in-class quizzes) were require, but over half the class was always on their laptops.

And the midterm/final were so frustrating - both happened during corona season so maybe this isn't how it normally goes, but while they were open note (a blessing) they both included things that were not in the slides and that we were not taught. Overall, the class had potential to be very engaging and useful, but left me frustrated and disappointed that I didn't learn anything (and even then was tested on things we weren't taught...).I'm still expecting an A/A-, so that's a positive I guess."

She gives 5-10 min breaks in the middle of class where she lets you relax and answers any question you might have, while playing Tom and Jerry clips on the projector, or something else funny. She has pop-quizzes so you need to go to class. These quizzes are super easy though, usually just one question. She gives extra credit points to people for voluntarily answering certain questions. Her homeworks just consist of true/false, fill in the blank, multiple choice questions that are directly from her slides. Her programming assignments were mostly just going through longggg tutorials to understand concepts like getting familiar with AWS EC2, learning about Docker, working with MapReduce, configuring a multi-node Hadoop cluster, etc. We had 2 exams: a midterm and final. Both of them were online and open-notes for our semester due to the covid situation. The exams had too many questions for the amount of time given, especially the midterm. Everyone complained about not finishing, but maybe it was because we wasted time here and there confirming our answers with her slides, which we wouldn't be allowed to do if the exam was in person (she does allow a cheat sheet for in-person exams though). One thing that she did before each exam that no professor ever does is tell you which exact slides from each PowerPoint you need to study for the exam so that you are not studying unecessary slides. This was really helpful. Overall, this class is an easy A-/B+. You don't really learn anything, so don't take this class if that's what you're looking for; take is with Humphrey instead. Reading reviews is necessary before taking a class, so don't get mad if Shen is not teaching like how you would want her to. She is the sweetest person and tries bettering her teaching style every semester, so give her a break!Here is the Course Breakdown:  PA (20%), HW (20%), Midterm (20%), Final (20%), In-Class Quizzes (20%), Extra Credit (5%)."

The content itself isn't particularly compelling — compared to other instructors, who I've been told give more hands-on experience with the assignments, Shen's material focuses on more computer-architecturey concepts that don't really have any relevance to you if you're not into that kind of stuff. The lectures themselves are boring (I stopped going after the first week), but the content doesn't really matter because the course is incredibly easy. The written homeworks are 90% just copying verbatim from the provided slides and are autograded, meaning you are actively incentivized to NOT use your own words in your answers. The programming assignments are mostly just instruction-following and don't really give any meaningful level of experience with something like AWS. (Also one of them requires you to make *two* 80GB VMs on your machine because lmao)The worst part, however, is the exams. For some reason, and I have literally never had a class before where this was the case, the instructional staff thinks it's a good idea to deliberately not release announcements about exam logistics via email. Multiple people posted Piazza questions asking days before the midterm, and either received non-answers or were completely ghosted. Quote from the professor explaining this policy: \"It was explained in at least two classes. It is not fair to other students if we write it in Piazza. The best way is to ask another student...We do not put all information in slides, documents or piazza since it is a lecture class and we need to keep fairness for students.\" I'm not really sure how simply making sure everyone knows what the exam is going to be could possibly be interpreted as unfairness, but I guess that's the policy.Only take this class if you want to fill space in your schedule; you'll get next-to-nothing out of it."

Neither the TA's or professor who made the homework could not answer a baseline \"crucially important\" arithmetic question from the homework when asked about it in the review session and only said, \"you should have notes on this from an earlier class.\" This is the first review I have written on this website because I feel like it is important to share the awareness so nobody ends up making the same mistake that I did in choosing an elective with a teaching staff that does not care about you or your learning."

The notes are not extensive and barely dive into the information that the course is supposed to cover. In a nutshell, the notes are basically basic definitions with clipart. The programming assignments are simple amazon tutorials that will not give you knowledge of how to use AWS. The professors care absolutely zero about the class and spend more time creating problems than anything else. Class communication is horrendous as information is given over email, collab, piazza, or verbally in lecture without warning, and you are constantly playing a guessing game to find out where information comes from. When you do miss a piece of info and have a question the professor either ignores your question or tells you to go on piazza to find an answer in which you go look at piazza only to see that the professor will not answer your question and shame you for asking about a piece of information that was not given in the first place but is essential to completing some assignment. Other comical or rude examples include when the professor does not want to answer a question or doesn't know the answer and hands it over to her TA Tanmoy who does not know the answer himself and will stall and then give you a vague answer that is impossible to interpret. The exam was not reflective of the material in the slides and the assignments and many students who studied extensively for the assignment were left in the dark. On top of this, before the exam students asked about the format of the exam so they could prepare and learn material from the course but were shot down by the professor on piazza who was adamant about not providing this info. Then on the day of the exam many faced network issues which were not addressed by the course staff. Another example of why this class is a dumpster fire is available in the other course forum posts and I found I did not need to repeat what was already said.

Professor Humphrey is a dry humor kinda guy, almost intimidating and makes you feel dumb when you ask clarifying questions, but he's pretty cool--kinda like a dad. Anyway, the lectures are boring and I didn't even know what was going on most of the time, but I took notes anyway. Taking good notes will be your saving grace, because the slides are pretty useless. The programming assignments were REALLY cool though. Very realistic and utilized actual things we could use in real life like working with load balancers in AWS and and programming code for Amazon Alexa--pretty cool stuff. If it weren't for the homework assignments, I would probably not have enjoyed the class. As far as tests go, review your notes carefully and memorize everything. The tests are pretty wacky and ask a lot of high level things that may not have been directly said in class, so just be prepared for anything. Other than that, I don't think this class is too difficult, just make sure you get A's on all the programming assignments and you will be fine."

It's fairly non-traditional for a CS class in that there's a lot more discussion, nuance, and some things about the industry that you'll just have to straight up memorize.-Marty's sense of humor can rub some people the wrong way, but most people liked him in our class.\nThe grades/assignments breakdown:\nOur semester had 7 programming assignments. They all start off with some level of tutorial stuff and getting your feet wet so to speak. Can be a bit hard to do at the last moment, but overall fairly reasonable, as you get like 9 or 10 days for each assignment. These accounted for 50% of the grade.\nGo to class and get participation points. 10%.\n1 midterm, 1 final, lots of material from the slides.\nOverall, a worthwhile and decently fun class to take. I didn't always manage my time well or study the material super super hard, but it was still interesting, and really useful (talked about load balancers and AWS in an interview and got the job, so credit to Marty)"

Humphrey's very good about teaching the newest, most useful cloud technologies (he regularly updates assignments to reflect important topics that are useful for current industry). I've applied what I learned in this class for hackathons and even impressed my managers at AWS with my background knowledge from this course. Humphrey asks students thought-provoking questions in class and has a somewhat dry sense of humor (which I enjoy) as other reviews have pointed out. The course load is largely coding assignments, but they're pretty interesting and all take under 10 hours to complete. Do be careful about details on the tests though. Overall, 10/10 would recommend."

For instance, someone pointed out a disparity between code he wrote and the assignment write-up and he replied \"I don't understand -- I don't see a question here\" but then proceeded to correct the write-up. Meanwhile, the assignments' code and structures are poorly-written: the first assignment was basically a step-by-step set of instructions with absolutely no explanation as to what we were actually doing, and the second assignment has a blatant race condition, convoluted I/O piping, and numerous other bugs. Skip this class and just follow some AWS tutorial online."

In most cases, it seems like this would improperly skew the analysis. yes?\"His favorite line, \"I don't really understand this question,\" is totally unnecessary. And he could answer in a nicer tone.\nCASE 2) Just finished programming assignment 5 and asked on Piazza what to shut off in AWS:Subject: \"PA4 - What to turn off\"Body: \"What else do we need to turn off in AWS aside from the sagemaker?\"Instead of replying, \"I think you meant PA5, but just follow step 10 of the assignment,\" he acts dumb and responds, \"PA4? Sagemaker?\"Bro, you know I'm talking about PA5. Just. Answer. The. Damn. Question.\nCASE 3) I went to office hours, and during the meeting, he repeatedly asked me, \"so what's your question?\" while I was explaining my problem. He also sighed audibly multiple times and once loudly proclaimed, \"NO NO NO NO NO!\" Seriously? I've never dealt with a single professor before Marty who didn't show their students a minimal level of civility.\nCONT. It's not even like his lectures and assignments are good enough to counterbalance his personality. His lectures are dry and incredibly boring. Someone else said, \"For a guy who speaks like 3 words a minute and mostly just shows us AWS ads in class\" and I died laughing!! Tis true. His slides are bare and useless. It's also very confusing half the time because he doesn't explain it well starting from the start.\nHis assignments are either just step-by-step instructions with no explanation, or the assignments have no guidance and have just one instruction telling you what to build. Either way, you learn little, and I'm probably getting an A. The only thing I'm taking away from this class in practical terms is how to create an EC2 instance and SCP into it.\nTL;DR: stay away from this professor. He sucks. Most people recommending him obviously haven't taken it with him. If you have the chance to take this class with another professor who likely gives the same assignments but lectures better and has a better attitude, TAKE IT.\nP.S. If you do decide to this his class, some advice: As someone else said, \"taking good notes will be your saving grace, because the slides are [very] useless.\" That's how I got an A on the exams. Most of the MC questions were particular things he talked about in class, so you can't rely on quizlets for those. Programming assignments are fairly easy to get 100s on though and not too much effort or too time-consuming, so don't stress out about that. Just don't start them last minute. If you do well on the PAs and exams, it's an easy A.\nEDIT: idk why TCF doesn't display my linebreaks, so blame them for this post being one big, unreadable blob. Thank you for reading."

It's worth looking into the tech he talks about in class on your own time for a better picture. From what I saw from his interactions on Discord and Piazza, he definitely didn't seem super helpful during office hours or on Piazza either.\nThe programming assignments were pretty cool though. I was really into cloud computing and had prior AWS experience before I entered this class, so this was my favorite part of the class. However, almost every assignment was poorly worded, had typos, or contained outdated information  (I get that AWS changes a lot, but come on man, check instead of using us to find the mistakes in the assignment for you), and the majority of the starter code he gave us was ripped from tutorials off of google, so this was incredibly frustrating.\nDifficulty wise, not bad at all, easy A CS elective.\nThis is the most applicable class to industry I've taken here, and there's a lot of things you can build now that you're aware of all of these different technologies and concepts. I still feel like I learned a lot in this class despite all it's shortcomings. All in all, pretty good class that needs some tweaking."

On Piazza, he'll often answer questions very indirectly or not at all. In lecture, he would occasionally call students out unnecessarily when they answered a question incorrectly. I didn't go to office hours but I heard they could be a challenge as well.- Sometimes, the labs were confusing or had mistakes. I usually started them late because he cleared up those confusions in lecture. The exams were hard but being open-internet helped out a lot.- Lecture speed. He speaks really slowly for an AM class. I watched the recordings at 1.5 speed.PROS:- The lectures were really useful to get you thinking about the \"right tool for the job\". We surveyed a bunch of different cloud computing tools and learned what dimensions to compare them on, like price, speed, etc. Although he was partial to AWS, we went over a lot of different platforms.- Very up-to-date. Humphrey has industry experience and he updates the lectures to cover the latest technologies (e.g. GPUs and TPUs, blockchain, hybrid cloud). This is something you can't find often in academia.- Lots of practical experience with AWS. I learned a lot about cloud computing not only in theory but also how to use AWS tools. It's a really relevant skill and pretty interesting too.#tCFspring2021"

            "text": "SUMMARY: This course gets a solid \"Meh\" from me. It is not a particularly difficult course, especially if you have already gone through Advanced Software Development. None of the topics are very hard to understand (although the professor does try to make them hard to understand at times, it seems), and the homeworks are all pretty easy. GRADING: Grades break down like so: 20% homework assignments (usually can work with 1-2 partners), 20% practice of the days (POTDs -- Usually one per week. They are essentially very simple assignments that keep you engaged with the current material. Should not take more than an hour or two to complete each, if that), 30% project, and 30% final exam. PROJECT: The only real annoyance of the course is the project. You will work with 2-4 other students (3-4 students is recommended) on developing some sort of application (typically a web app, but you can create a desktop app as well, if you choose) that incorporates elements of database development. This project has the potential to be really cool, but the problem is that most people do not know PHP coming into the course, which is the only language Upsorn really even mentions or gives examples for linking to MySQL DBs in class. So, most groups are forced into learning PHP. While Upsorn \"teaches\" PHP, it is really hard to gain critical parts of it from two 50 minute lectures of watching her code very specific examples in it. So, really, you are on your own if you want to do anything beyond that. As a result, most of the projects that groups do in the course only achive the bear minimum required to get the best grade possible. It is not like CS3240 in which you see a lot of effort put into some of the projects. The project is 30% of your grade, but only 1/4 of that 30% is dependent on your final deliverable and PHP code. The other 3/4 are based on your project proposal (we finished that in around 2-3 hours), database design milestone (~6-8 hours depending on how complicated your project is), and MySQL implementation milestone (~4-6 hours depending on how compliated). These three milestones are spread out to be due every 3 weeks and none of them use PHP -- so to be clear, this project is really not that hard. But the final deliverable milestone is very annoying. FINAL EXAM: I will update this post with info about the final, but I have heard from previous students that it is not that hard. Additionally, at least in this COVID semester, the exam is open book. So, it should not be very difficult. PROFESSOR: Upsorn is very kind and approachable. No one has any problems getting along with her. However, her lectures are sometimes a bit convoluted and confusing which, when combined with her excessively wordy slides, makes for lectures that are difficult to track, even if you are watching a recording. As such, if there was ever a topic that came up that I was a bit confused about (this only happened 3 times -- again, the material is not very difficult), I would look up a youtube video that explained everything in like 5 minutes.  Make of that what you will, but I am personally not a fan of her lectures. ENJOYMENT: I would call it below average. you are kind of bored most of the time because much of the material is either obvious, or things that you question whether you really need to know. There is some good stuff sprinkled in though, so don't completely dismiss the material. USEFULLNESS: If you are planning on working with software that heavily uses databases, and you have never really worked with them before, this course does provide an excellent introduction into the thought process behind their development. But, honestly, DBs are simple enough that I would argue that most people could pick up the material while on the job, making the course kind of like a head-start in the knowledge, but not super useful in the long run. WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR?: If you are taking an extremely time-consuming CS course, like Algo, OS, Comp Arch, or the like, this is a fantastic choice as a \"complementary\" course that will fulfill a CS elective requirement slot, and take up another 3 credits on your transcript, all while not destroying your schedule. (For that reason, it also a good choice for the 4th year \"coasting to graduation\" semesters, if you are fortunate enough to be in a position to do so). That is the course's biggest strength. It is also required for the cybersecurity focal path (for some reason, idk why), so if you are doing that, you will have to take this course sooner or later. Finally, I have never really heard anyone who is just dying to know and understand all about DBs, but if you are one of the odd few, you may get some enjoyment out of it. WHO IS THIS COURSE NOT FOR?: If you are trying to fill your schedule up with meaningful classes that will be relevant in the workforce and don't need it for some other requirement, I would avoid this class for the reasons mentioned above. You will consider it a waste of time."

I found the class to be fairly easy, despite not going to lectures or ever watching the recorded lecture videos. I was able to complete all weekly \"in class\" assignments within 30 minutes or so by just skimming through the slides. The homeworks required a bit more effort, but were also reasonable to do with the slide skimming technique. I think this is because most of this course could probably be condensed into three or four weeks instead of a whole semester. The project was graded leniently imo - I don't think my group's website was very good, but we got full credit. As long as you do the bare minimum with respects to the database programming, the rest of the site won't matter and you'll get full points. The exam was sadly unfair. The exam was \"designed to be completed in three hours,\" but we had a 12hr window to do it (covid semester, so timezone differences were in play). The exam was, in fact, not a three hour exam. There was a huge piazza thread where everyone was sharing their experience and talking about how, despite taking 10+ hours to do the exam, they did not complete it. I spent 5.5 hours and only completed maybe 70-75% of the exam, and I would consider myself to be a fast worker. The mean score was high (83% or something), so no curve was given. This was unfairly advantageous to people who spent more time and unfair disadvantageous to those who only allotted themselves 3 hours. I don't care much since I went CR/NC anyway, but my blood would be boiling if I took this class for a grade and saw an A+ turn into a B+ over something like this.\n#tCF2020"

Instead, you have a project that you spend a ton of time on, which is worth a lot of your grade.

I recommend taking this class for both a fun and educational overview of databases with one of the kindest professors in the UVA CS department!!"

To me, a lot of it isn't too interesting and it seems monotonous. However, I think this class has tremendously helped me improve my query language skills (SQL, SQLite, PostgresSQL, NoSQL, MySQL) and has helped me learn more about queries and databases that I probably had never considered before. Sometimes it feels like a lot of work (just in terms of how often it's assigned) in the class (maybe depending on prof) but in the end I think it has really helped me get better with advanced querying of databases because of all the practice. Overall, class was a bit dry (but that's because I think the topic just inherently is) and sometimes I felt like not all things were explained too in depth, but, in the end, helpful for improving my query language skills."

Most of the stuff is conceptual and you will learn a lot about data. This course is great if you want an easy course and learn useful material. There is a project that involves quite a bit of programming knowledge in web development (PHP, HTML, CSS) and we learn SQL in the class. The project can be put on your resume! The material is relevant if you want to work with data in your job/internship, i.e. data scientist, data mining, machine learning, database stuff, etc...

I started studying for the second exam the night before the exam having not gone to class for two months and got a 93 on it. It's literally that easy, just memorize some terms and be able to explain them at a high level. Basit is really easy but she seems to care about her students. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this class if you actually want to learn about databases - the only thing I got out of this class was a high-level understanding of SQL and some basic SQL commands. I already knew PHP so the final project which used it didn't benefit that much. However, if you're new to PHP the final project might help a bit with AJAX/PHP/SQL/full-stack web development.\nEither way, very easy class and very little time commitment. Try to figure out which TA is the nicest grader as my group just kept submitting our homeworks to that TA and getting 100s on them lol."

Lecture is not recorded but she provides detailed slides, as well as code examples once the class gets into SQL. We were allowed to work with others for the POTDs (graded for completion) and homeworks. The final project had assignments throughout the semester that aligned with course concepts we were learning at the time, culminating in a short final presentation.\nThere were three quizzes (not cumulative) and no final exam. The quizzes were 30 points in total, with 10 points for MCs and 20 points for applicative questions (ex. writing queries). The quizzes were pretty doable, the MCs are straight-forward and the applicative questions are fair. Reviewing all of the assignments/in-class practice problems, as well as the quiz review slides (which is the lecture before the quiz) helped a lot."

Tests were difficult but reasonable if you paid attention, read the slides, studied, etc., but therein lies the issue---  He lectures off the slides that come with the textbook (which you can find for free online), and those slides aren't great. He has a strong accent, but some students like myself got used to that, and he's trying harder to improve that. But his lecturing style is not engaging and the material is already fairly dry. Abdeltawab also had guest lecturers multiple times and was out of town, as well as telling students to do presentations etc, most likely because he didn't want to teach any more than he absolutely had to. DB is kinda useful but because of how boring it is, this ended up being the worst class I've taken in my 4 years at UVA, and I've taken a lot of god awful classes. A different slide-set would probably make the material that much better. But really though, you learn all you need about databases from web PL or cloud or something similar.

Next week's homework usually released on Thursday or Friday. Sometimes a reading from the textbook due on Friday (expect a 10-minute pop quiz). Attendance randomly taken--this happened more consistently toward the end of the semester.\nBloomfield was designing this course as he was teaching it, so some of the homeworks were a complete flop and the weighting was completely readjusted, but it was a solid intro to network security and the TAs were a gift from God. If you've ever taken a class with Bloomfield, you can expect the same general structure/difficulty of grading in this one. My biggest complaint from this semester was how inaccessible Bloomfield was. Hopefully his support request system and OH times will be better next semester.\n#tCFS24"

The exams were challenging, as he asked math questions and fine details. The second codeathon was also incredibly stressful, but I got lucky and some classmate shared a tip with some of us to get insanely high performance at OH.

Rich goes into a lot of detail during his lectures and a lot of the math went straight over my head. I found the lectures kind of boring, but the coding assignments were rewarding. You learn a lot about different ML models like Random Forest, Decision trees, etc. in the first part and neural networks in the second part of the course.\nGrading is 40% programming assignments (4), 15% codeathons (3), 30% exams (midterm and final), and 15% the group project. The schedule is a little annoying in that there'll be no work for a couple of weeks and then a bunch of assignments in a row. The programming assignments aren't super difficult but will probably require you to go to OH a couple of times for help. The codeathons are more challenging and also take longer to run, so I would definitely start those as early as possible (ESPECIALLY codeathon 2 since it's convolutional neural nets). The coding is a mix of implementing algorithms from scratch and using built-in libraries like ScikitLearn and Keras. The final project is also interesting since we implement the models we learned on a dataset of our choosing but tbh only the first codeathon is relevant. Do as much extra credit as you can because then you won't stress as much about the assignments.\nThe midterm was a mix of application and conceptual questions, and it was online and open-note. For the conceptual questions, you can use your notes, but the application questions were unnecessarily time-consuming (like he made us calculate the information gain for 4 different variables when it really only takes one or two to check if we understand how it works.) Other than being a little time-consuming, I didn't think the midterm was horrible (ended up with over a hundred on it since there was a bonus question).\n#tCFfall2021"

He goes a great job of preparing you for exams. What he says will be on the test, is on the test.  The homework assignments are very time-consuming and difficult. If you don't have a really good handle on C or C++, this will be the hardest class of the semester. If you are stuck, so is everyone else, so your best bet is to work on them homework as soon as assigned and go to both the Professor and the TA's office hours every time you are stuck, otherwise you can spend hours and even days trying to get your code to work. Seriously, don't take this class if you haven't programmed in C before. You should at least try to complete a C tutorial book before this class, preferably the semester before registering for OS."

You will get very little practice as a result. The homework he does end up assigning will be very trivial, and you will not learn very much. It's an easy grade though.\nThe instructor will also frequently go over-time and keep you for at least 5-10 minutes with students for the next class waiting at the door. There was no syllabus/schedule of contents of the course. Frequently, he will either forget his the upshot of his own examples or realize his examples don't work, and new ones need to be made on the spot.\nSome classes are just half review even if everyone understands what's going on, resulting in an excruciatingly slow pace. Even if everyone knows what's going on, the instructor will assume you don't know anything. If you sit in the back, he will really assume you're clueless. Even if you volunteer answers frequently, he will proceed as if you didn't say anything. He seems very arrogant as a result. His tone can be very condescending, and he tends to get on his soapbox and overexplain very simple math concepts. This is a graduate course where everyone has taken some form of discrete math. We do not need a 30 minute explanation of the definition of an equivalence class. Generally, he speaks as if he wishes he were a mathematician; he seems very proud of knowing what a group is for example.\nI entered this course wanting to learn about formal methods applied to software, which was mentioned in the beginning of the semester. Instead I barely learned the basics of Lean. For anything else, this class was not worth it."

This is simply a rehashing of an undergraduate operating systems course, except the material is explained in a far worse manner. The course involves programming an embedded systems microcontroller using Keil, a frustrating and unstable IDE. When it does work, the assignments are vague and aren't conducive to learning anything new, especially for graduate CS students. Alemzadeh's methods of explanation are so poor and inadequate compared to CS professors teaching OS courses that basic OS questions become difficult to answer when she poses them. During lectures, she was rarely able to answer questions asked by students; answers typically included phrases like \"yes, that is something to consider\" or \"I'm not sure about that\". Other students in the course often proposed answers in the absence of one from Alemzadeh. During lecture, she accused students of being rude simply for shaking their heads and even tried to refuse a student the opportunity to take the mid-term exam because they rarely came to class (recordings of lectures were posted, so coming to class was not strictly necessary). Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Alemzadeh until these issues are resolved."

The course had a pretty straightforward homework assignment every other week and 4 mini-projects that build on itself throughout the semester, which involved programming a low level microcontroller (it's all in C which is a bit annoying). The mini-projects culminated in a final group project that was very doable if the work was split up between group members. Each student also gives a presentation about a related research paper. There was a final exam which was pretty straightforward if you study the past exams she provides. Overall, there is a good amount of work but none of it is very difficult and a lot of the course content is likely review from undergrad courses."

It was a great course, except ROS has a pretty steep learning curve for beginners in my opinion, so I think it might have been great to have some class time allocated to understanding the structure of ROS, more than just following Tutorials on the Website. Once you understand how it works, however, everything makes sense. It was still an interesting class and gave me a lot of insight on programming for robots."

This seemed like a drag at times but most of the time you were reading very interesting research papers which really helped with your ability to read research and helped keep you updated in the field. The lectures were very well done, although they were few. The rest of the class was presentations on research papers. If you're a grad student with any interest in deep learning or an undergrad with interest in research and deep learning, Vicente's class is a must take."

This was easily my favorite class from Fall 2021 (the review is filed under Fall 2017 because tCF doesn't handle \"Special Topics in ...\" very well, sadly). One of the topics we discussed the most was how a building can detect occupants, whether as a boolean value (occupied or not) or an integer (x people in a room). It's an interesting question that gets far more complex than I ever would have considered before. This course did not involve a great deal of work, but was by far the course I learned the most from this semester. It's a great example of how more coursework != more learning. Speaking of coursework, we completed a few lab assignments (not too challenging), a 3 assignments (two individual, research-focused and one group, implementation-focused), led a class discussion on a particular topic from the readings, and a final group project involving sensing a building state (i.e. temperature), processing that state data, and actuating some physical device accordingly."

The course involves 4 homework assignments which were definitely more difficult than I expected - start them early or you will end up regretting it. There is a research paper to read each week that you will be quizzed on so read the papers and each student presents on one of the papers. There is a final project that can be on anything related to software analysis so you have a lot of flexibility to do something you are interested in. Overall, this course was more difficult than I was expecting, but I definitely learned a lot and the work load wasn't too bad. I think it would have been worse with a different professor, but Professor Elbaum seems to genuinely care about his students and keeps the lectures engaging which is a lot more than I can say about most CS professors."

At first it was easy, very basic concepts, didn't pay attention in lecture or look at notes once until about 2-3 weeks before the midterm. Then the material started picking up, it was not as easily comprehensible. I disliked how the class didn't have an attendance policy, because I had no motivation to go. You only have to be there every other Friday for a lab. Homeworks were doable, and labs were fine if you had a good group. Overall, would've been an A if I put more effort, but I got into such a habit of not paying attention to this class because of the speed at the beginning that I had no time or motivation in me at the end when the rest of my classes picked up as well. The concepts learned are useful, however, and have helped me in my other Politics classes."

I took her class, STAT 1602, in the fall of 2024 (this is not showing up on Course Forum for some reason), and I DEEPLY regret it. She runs her class so differently than the other professors, and it gets really frustrating, especially when you hear how much easier all the other sections are in comparison to hers.\nShe requires attendance for labs, which is the most tedious thing ever because you go in and sit for a good 20 minutes to watch her give a lecture that goes in one ear and out the other because it’s so UNENGAGING. Then, she has us sit to do a 'lab.' None of the other classes require attendance, and honestly, her lectures aren’t helpful at all or intuitive, so I end up self-teaching the material.\nI am premed, so honestly, right off the bat, statistics is not something I like or care about, and I hate coding with a passion. I have to take this class because it is strongly recommended for my major, so I might be a bit biased, but there is no reason for AN INTRO CLASS to be this difficult and to have THIS MUCH discrepancy between the sections. Even the exams are not the same; she makes them insanely long and difficult for no reason, and she’s not a lenient grader.\nThis is an intro class, and I never expected it to be an easy A. I genuinely went into it kind of excited to learn something new outside of my premed classes, but she’s made my experience so awful, especially with her teaching style being so uninteresting and unengaging."

The homeworks are really simple and he doesn't knock off crazy points for some errors and he's a really light grader so if you do terribly you would still get at least an 80. The labs are literally homework assignments so don't stress but try to get a 100%. Do some practices on excel because you will be using it a lot throughout the semester but a couple of YouTube video will do good. The midterm is hilariously easy so just study some terms and no real hard math and you will be fine. The final on the other hand is something else and I think it's a UVA tradition to make a final ridiculously hard."

He would go super in depth (unnecessarily) and a lot of the material kind of went right over my head.\nThe class is 20% quizzes (they were pretty easy and we were allowed to drop a few of them), 40% homework (mostly in python, allowed to drop 2), 10% midterm, 20% project, and 10% final exam. The homework was relatively easy and he grades them pretty leniently in my opinion, and the midterm and final exam were fair. The final project wasn't too bad either.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this class if you want a relatively easy class (especially if you need an integration elective).\n#tCFfall22"

Homework consists of the biggest chunk of your grade, which you have unlimited attempts for each problem on Gradescope, which is a lifesaver. The midterm was a bit tricker than expected and the final was a breeze, but both count as minimal parts of the final grade. Overall, great and easy class. #tCFspring2021"

Nice organization where all class notes were basically transcribed in the day's R file, and solutions to class problems were posted afterward. Canvas page was also very organized and easy to refer back to. Overall, just a really organized class with a fair, transparent, organized professor that makes the whole experience smooth! Grade breakdown was 40% HW, 20% Check-ins (short canvas quizzes once in a while), 40% final project. Course content was a very practical starting pt for data sci I think! Learned how to write in base R and use popular libraries like dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot. Some skills u learn are basic data cleaning, data wrangling, finding summary statistics, data visualizations like scatter plots and histograms. Course doesn't go too deep into Statistics but the towards the end u have a unit on hypothesis testing, so you will learn how to use R to find test null hypotheses, find its p-value, etc."

I was not excited to take this class as a psych major with no interest in coding, but that completely changed. Prof. Roland is very friendly and willing to answer all the questions we had with coding. Grades were composed of weekly homework (30%), weekly quizzes (20%), three class activities (10%), final project check ins (10%), and the final project (30%). The first half of the semester, the homeworks took me 30 mins max, but as we got deeper into coding, the later ones took me 2+ hours, but they were all very doable. There are also 8 TA office hours per week and a Piazza board that Prof. Roland is responsive on. For quizzes, they were timed for around 20 minutes, and we had two attempts and our score was averaged. She also let us drop our lowest homework/quiz grade which was helpful. It is easy to succeed in this class with the vast number of assignments and the availability of support. The only thing I would note is that Prof. Roland is not flexible with turning things in late. If you forget to turn something in, too bad. She seems really strict with this policy, but also has the built in drop homework/quiz to balance that out, so it's your responsibility to stay on top of the work. Overall, I highly recommend this class with Prof Roland! She is very friendly, knowledgeable, and committed to us succeeding, just make sure you turn things in on time and utilize the resources available. #tCFS24"

There are many office hours, so help is always there for you to use. This is still a valuable class to learn from. Just know that she is strict with deadlines, so if you miss one, you are out of luck. She drops several of the lowest grades in each category.

It probably bears mentioning that I came into this class with some programming experience, but I still think that I can confidently classify this as an easy course.  All assignments are done through unlimited-submission autograders, meaning that in theory the only points you could lose in this course are to the small \"hidden checks\" in the homework assignments.  This format, combined with the fact that everything is open resource/friend/professor, means that you shouldn't have to worry too much about this class if you're willing to put in the work (how much work that actually equates too will depend on your own comfort with the material).  There is a minimal amount of lecture in this class, with the rest of the time devoted to work.  This meant that many days I was able to able to leave class early if I was already done with the current assignments.  Despite all this, R remains a useful tool in statistical analysis and a solid resume padder, so this class certainly isn't without practical value.\n#tCFF23"

Prof starts off class with a fun story from his week or life in Ghana and makes a lot of jokes during class. He usually let us out a few minutes early and always stayed behind for questions. Afriyie does a lot of live coding in class, but has a powerpoint to give an overview of the concepts. While class focused a lot on using and implementing functions, the exams are super conceptual (you don't really write any code) and you have to memorize what all the functions do. There were one or two questions on the exams that were tricky, but he ended up curving the exams. There were 8 homework assignments and he dropped our lowest grade. He releases homework a week before it is due and he will tell you if the material he is going over in class is on the homework. Prof posted all the notes and code on Collab, and attendance was not mandatory. Also, be sure to make friends in this class because you can choose to work with a group on the final project. I'm usually not one to like going to lecture and but I really enjoyed this class. I should disclose though that I am a CS major, and only took this class because I needed another 3 credits. If you have no previous coding experience, you might find this class challenging in the beginning. Prof isn't trying to make this class exceptionally difficult and will take the time to explain anything. Don't be afraid to ask questions in class, and if you have any questions on the hw make sure you go to his OHs or set up an appointment with him."

He was super nice and kind, always asking us how are lives are, even if nobody answered. His online pre-recorded lectures were super cute, he would sometimes stop for a couple seconds and tell us to go outside and get fresh air (I never did and just kept listening but it was nice to have him be cognizant of his students' mental health). The class is just a lot of coding, and he isn't the best at explaining concepts, but if you approach him for help, he is super nice and helpful. I was worried about the final project because my friend had told me how harshly hers was graded, but I ended up with a pretty good grade on it. It was also kinda fun to do.

The professor was so kind and caring towards his students and wanted to get to know us. In class he would ask us about our days to the whole class and would pause often to ask if anyone had any questions. He often talks about his cute little son during class and even used him in an example in class. In the shift to online, he would put clips in the middle of the lectures telling his students to go outside and breath or to go on a short walk which I appreciated so greatly. I did not find the coding in R that difficult as I had prior experience coding being a CS major however I do not think that people without experience would struggle as the professor explains things at a slow pace that may make the class seem even slow at times. The lectures are also not mandatory except for of course exam dates. The homeworks assigned every week took me not too long to complete as I often completed them in one sittings and I would suggest going to TA office hours after as the TAs will often tell you if you did a question incorrectly and how you should instead do it so it is almost a 100 guarantee on the HW. However I will say that the exams are not super easy and do requires studying in order to do well on. Additionally the final project at the end of the semester required a lot of time and dedication as it encompassed things that we have learned throughout the entire semester. I would still recommend this class because it was definitely manageable and is low stress for the most part."

I'd recommend emailing the TAs with questions about them because you're almost guaranteed a good grade if you ask for clarification and help. These assignments are 30% of your grade, so it's important to do well on each one (Prince drops the lowest one). The exams were not super easy, as there were some specific questions, but they weren't super hard. He wasn't against curves either, he curved our first exam, and was open to doing it on one of our homework assignments. The final project isn't hard, it's lengthy and takes time, but working in a group makes it doable. Take this class!! Prince is the best"

As some other people have said, I was worried about taking the class after reading some of the reviews about the fall, but it goes to show that he was willing to take the reviews to heart.  I took STAT 2120 before it required the coding portion, so I thought it would be interesting to take this class.  I really struggled in 2120 because of all the equations that we had to know and the difficult concepts, but in this class R is SO helpful!  In lectures, Prince breaks it down by showing a slideshow and also doing live coding.  I ended up taking screenshots of the coding and inserting them into my notes which helped tremendously.  There was no required reading, and the only thing you have to do each week is the HWs which count for 30% of your overall grade.  I recommend you work with friends or find other classmates, as well as consult with the TAs; they are there to help!  The HWs really are not hard, but just make sure you are paying attention, take good notes, and get help when needed.  When we switched to online classes, Prince was very accommodating and his videos were easy to comprehend.  He also was cognizant about not making them too long, and he would remind students to take breaks in the middle of them which I loved.  The final project required a decent amount of time, but as long as you communicate with you're group and understand the material, you should be fine.  I also didn't find exams to be that hard, again as long as you know what you are doing in R and especially for the second exam, you have to understand the statistical concepts more in depth.  The first half of the semester is a lot more coding than statistics itself, but the second half is both so it can be more difficult.  Prince is such a sweet man and I really loved this class.  It is not necessarily an easy A, but if you do what is required and stay on top of understanding the material, you will do well!  Definitely take it if you have the chance!"

He would always suggest little breaks during the asynchronous recordings and show super cute pictures of his son. Assignments in this class (1x per week) were usually pretty easy, especially if you take notes during lectures. However, the 2 exams were nothing like these assignments. All the questions on those were really conceptual and not practical uses of R. This class is necessary for the psych major, so there's no real way to avoid it and maybe it's easier in person, but overall I didn't learn much and this class hurt my GPA."

In terms of grades, 20/20 for all homework since it was relatively easy if you paid attention and took good notes. Tests are straight froward. Group project also doable.

Bagley is a great person, he's funny and down to earth, but as a teacher, avoid him like the plague. All he does it read off of his pre-prepared R Studio notes, which are not easy to follow along with. The class format consists of him running various lines of pre-prepared code without telling you the specifics about each line of code; therefore, for someone that does not have any experience with statistics or coding with R, you will absolutely be struggling in this class. There is virtually no helpful explanation from this professor. Although this is an introductory course, his lectures give off the vibe that he expects that his students already know the basics. I know this is a required course for Psychology majors now, but if anyone else is teaching, maybe you will have better luck than I did."

The homework takes 2 hours at the most and there are ample office hours to get help.  The TA will give you everything you need at office hours to get it done.  Prof Bagley is cool and makes the lectures as enjoyable as they can be with the content.  It's listed as a 75 minute lecture, but he lets everybody go after 45 minutes and the rest of the class is just extra office hours.

This is legitimately my first official CS class ever and I missed a significant number of classes due to illness this semester and was still able to easily get an A in the class even though I was scrambling with all of my other classes. Let me break this down.We only had 7 homework assignments. The lowest two hw grades are dropped, as someone else said. Then there's the final project which is basically a kind of investigatory (group or individual--it's your choice if you want to work with people or whom you wish to have as group partners) project that is guided by the questions you want to ask about a data set that he provides you with (you can make graphs and all kinds of stuff). The project isn't necessarily cumulative, but you should use coding techniques you've used from the entirety of the semester to get a good grade. Then you write a paper summarizing what you did.Class isn't necessary. I can vouch for that since I missed a freaking ton of lecture since I was either A) sick like you wouldn't believe/sleeping because of my medicine or B) trying to work on my other classesYep... this semester was not a fun time.But I can tell you that if you are struggling in this class, you are not meant for UVA. Actually, I do not understand how anyone can struggle in this class seeing as how Evan legitimately left thirty minutes at the end of lecture really to serve as office hours. There wasn't enough material in this class to justify going beyond two forty five minute classes per week.... so that meant there were the 'unofficial' class office hours and then also real office hours where you go to Evan or the TA's office and ask about code.Also, kids who were already familiar with python seemed to understand exactly what was going on in this class, so it seems like that helps a lot."

He went through different types of code and examples during class, then held informal office hours for the last thirty minutes of the class period. There were also numerous office hours during the week. The 7 homework assignments were a good way to practice the material, and 2 of them were dropped, so they were low-pressure. There was also a final project at the end of the semester that was a good way to synthesize what I had learned from the course.

This is class is extremely valuable moving forward in statistics and I feel that Bagley provides a very sufficient method of teaching it, along with his humor that makes some of the more dry lectures more entertaining. This class is definitely a break from your other higher STAT electives or whatever major you're in and is 100% an automatic A if you pay attention.  There are about 7 problem sets where he asks you to manipulate a data set or recreate various plots with the use of R worth 70% of your grade. The other 30% is a final project where, this semester, we chose 12 movies from a Netflix database and analyzed the data then composed an analytical report studying questions we came up with ourselves. No tests. Just problem sets and the project. The review below is right about the lecture being let out 30 minutes early. The office hours afterwards are extremely useful to ask those small questions that have you stuck on the problem set. Overall, It is definitely a fun course and gives you a taste of what data analytics has to offer, albeit a small taste. I believe this is a requirement for stats now so I hope my opinion makes you choose him. You will not regret it!"

In this course, there are 3 projects that you can work with other people on. I HIGHLY recommend starting the projects early because they are exponentially harder than homework and labs. There is one midterm and one final. These exams are 7 questions and not cumulative.  He has a lot of office hours throughout the week but I didn't find him to give helpful guidance.  I mostly relied on the demos he uploaded on collab and the internet. He gives us a link to a free textbook but it's not super helpful. His TA's (Kayla) office hours were quite helpful but they were only held ONCE a week which sucked. It would've have been better to have TA office hours more frequently.  Overall, I do not recommend this class. The class difficulty was not overly difficult because the coding is very basic however the wording on assignments was very confusing  & vague.

Previous knowledge in coding and statistics definitely helps, but is not necessary. I would explain it as coding basic functions in excel with python, but a lot of it was engaging and interesting. As with any class focused on coding, be prepared for some problem-solving and debugging and a few try hards who work weeks ahead.\nClass was 15-30 minutes of lecture and then time to work on assignments, attendance was optional and you can leave after the lecture. Sometimes lectures could be a little disorganized/confusing, but were overall okay. Everything was group work (you could do it by yourself, but I highly recommend finding a buddy in the class and working on everything together). Our grade came entirely from homeworks, labs, and projects which were all formatted basically the same as prompts for coding (labs had built in grader checks that checked for accuracy, the other two only had checks for formatting). It's all open note and you can work at your own pace. Depending on your experience, you can get about 75% of the work done in-class if you work the whole time and finish pretty quickly after class if you need to. Other people have said this is a lot of work for a 1000-level class, but I disagree. Maybe the format has changed, but it was very little work beyond the class time."

While I can't speak on Brown as a professor, I can somewhat speak about the course.\nI had no experience in statistics which didn't help since all the coding you did was based on statistics. Luckily, I was able to work with my classmates, TAs, and instructor whenever I needed help understanding the questions or when I was stuck in the middle of a code. Collaboration is the main reason I did well in this class. You are able to develop both your understanding of Python and Statistics in this course. Reading the textbook is homework. This was the main way I learned about statistics. I found it easier to address the textbook, slides, and lecture code once I was working on the assignment since the textbook sometimes didn't align with the assignment. The code was lowkey difficult, especially with little to no Python experience. It wasn't too hard at the beginning, but making friends with CS students made it so much easier. The TAs were especially helpful since they could explain it in simple terms. Overall, with the right help, you can understand the question, and with the right effort and help (if needed), you can complete the code yourself.\nLoved the course and made some great new friends there through collaboration. Oh also we don't use Pandas--not sure what it is, but people kept saying it so thought you should know. #tCFfall22"

From Stat majors I know, Prof. Brown is an awful prof who does not teach. But for this class, we were given a PhD student to be an instructor 2 days before class started. She was rly sweet but was forced to teach this class. There was little to no actual teaching, and I've heard even when Prof Brown is \"teaching,\" it is the same, which is why they got away with giving the class to a PhD student with little experience. Anyways, if you take this class, GOOGLE UCB DATA8. THEIR WEBSITE ACTUALLY POSTS THEIR LECTURES WHO HAVE COMPETENT PROFS/TAs DISCUSS THE CONTENT AND GO OVER EXAMPLES. This class was hell unless you had prior experience cause there was no one to teach you."

Webassign is infuriating because of its specificity in answers, so you need to use R. However, you can't use R on any of the tests, so you don't know how to do the problems. Contrary to what the reviews below me say, the 2 midterms and final exam are not easy. The group projects are extremely open ended and graded very harshly and once again, hardly tie into the course material.  Maria is cool, but she's a pretty bad lecturer and makes you feel stupid if you don't know what's going on. If you don't need this class, don't take it.

You're required to go to lab, but they basically just give you the code you need to submit the assignment. Labs assignments were also returned very late. The homework wasn't difficult, but it did take a lot of time. However, the homework doesn't correlate to the exam well at all. The group projects involving R were completely pointless and described so vaguely that you'd have no idea what you needed to do unless you went to office hours. Even then, people were told different things, so you're kind of left hoping that you have everything you need. For being so open ended, the projects were graded very strictly. Exams were multiple choice with maybe 1 free respone, and they were definitely tough because the types of questions on the exam were different from the problems we practiced in lecture.  This class was just so disorganized and it just always felt like nothing correlated from lab, to homework, to exams. I hope for the sake of future students that this course is structured much better than it was this semester. If you need a stat class, look elsewhere. If this class is a requirement, I'm sorry."

We used a statistics program called R, which involved writing a ton of code. The TAs didn't really teach us how to use R, they just showed us examples of things that we could do in R and then walked around as we struggled to complete our lab assignments.

This class used to be very easy and highly recommended by many science majors, but this year they changed it and the grade distribution is MUCH different.  The teachers just read directly off the slides and are not engaging at all. The labs are poorly prepared and not graded easily. During lab, students would just sit and wait for the TA's to give out the answers. One student even said they overheard the teacher saying that she wrote up the assignment the night before lab. The tests shouldn't be difficult, but they are so short that missing one or two question often brought your grade down a half a letter grade. The projects are poorly designed, graded very harshly, and brought down most people grades. On the projects, everyone gets the same grade which lead to a lot of people not contributing at all because they knew they would not be held accountable. The online homework assigned weekly doesn't seem to really help prep students for test either"

Going to office hours will definitely help your grade. Attendance is not mandatory, and do not waste money on the book."

Sometimes I felt the lectures were too short as the professor would be a bit rushed towards the end and I felt like I wasn’t getting all the info I needed. Overall the material was not too bad, I went in with no statistics knowledge but managed to understand the concepts just by doing practice and doing labs/hw. Something that helped me a lot was taking CS 1110 beforehand so I had a solid grasp on python and the coding portion wasn’t as bad. This class is pretty coding heavy and if you don’t know python you’re going to have to learn on the go, despite the lessons they make you do at the beginning of the semester. Thankfully the professor posts his scripts so you can just copy them, but it’s very helpful to understand what the code is actually doing. I wouldn’t recommend this class unless you have to take it, just because of the amount of time it takes up and that it’s not like it’s that fun, for most people at least."

He changes it not even a week before the exam and after we select credit/no credit. Why did he do that? About 5% of the class cheated on the last exam. So now, instead of just punishing them, we have to take a final that will easily take over 5 hours to complete in 3 hours! Makes a lot of sense Lil Boy Richie! Thanks for screwing the entire class over despite knowing this class is a prerequisite for tons of schools/majors.\nAs for an actual day to day class rating, he was okay. Far from the most interesting but just enough to keep you awake. Homework, labs, and lecture quizzes weekly- they aren't too bad. Homework can be rough at times, but in lab just get a good group who knows python.

Please don't believe any review that says this class was organized because it was far from it. Office hours are a the best way to make an afternoon disappear, because thats how long it will take to get your simple question answered. The 2nd midterm and final were a mess and a lot of it was self-induced. Prof Ross is passionate about stats and he did his best though, so don't worry about taking the course with him. If you show up, have a good lab group, and make friends with people that know python, you will get an A or A-. I think he knows he kind of screwed this semester up, so he gave us an extra 1% on the course grade and made the final very reasonable. It is hard to put the blame completely on him because the weird circumstances this semester, but know that you should not worry about taking with professor ross."

            "text": "Okay so the reviews I've seen for Ross are super harsh, which is why I feel compelled to write this review. For what it's worth, I am not a stats major and this class wasn't even a prerequisite for me, but I thought it would be useful to learn the content. First off, this class is a lot of work, but I think that's just the design of the course and not a fault of Ross. You have lab twice a week and homework around once a week, lectures twice a week, and post lecture quizzes twice a week. None of the work is actually that hard and nearly all of it can be done in groups. I would say that even though I hated going to lab sometimes, it really does force you to learn the material so I never thought I was behind on material and honestly knew the content better than the rest of my classes. Ross is SO nice, he really cares about students learning and put in way more effort during the transition to online by holding extra office hours, being available over email, and responsive on discussion boards. You have the opportunity to earn 2% extra credit by answering questions from your peers, he offered 1% extra credit for filling out course evals, and each midterm is only worth 10%. It's super doable, as long as you keep up with the workload each week. I think that utilizing office hours is also super helpful, especially TA office hours to check HW. So overall, I would totally recommend taking this class with Ross if you have to take 2120. He is approachable, makes his classes really easy and predictable, and the format of the course is just really easy to work into your schoolwork routine once you get the hang of it. The slides are straightforward and the content just isn't that hard. The downsides: TA grading is super annoying, I would get different grades than my friends sometimes even when we all worked together (which is allowed). I submitted regrade requests and eventually my grade would go up, but this is just annoying and needs to change next semester. Also, the midterms were super rushed. I didn't think the content was hard at all and the questions were fair game, but I just was rushing through them so quickly. It kinda sucked because I feel like they tested speed more than content mastery, since I could've done much better if I had more time to think on the problems. As for the finals thing....yeah Ross said we would get 2 days, then changed it to 3 hours after the CR/NC deadline which was really annoying but he definitely made up for this by making the final exam VERY doable for the 3 hour period, so I guess I forgive him, he really did the best he could do. Overall, though, as this was Ross's first semester teaching I think he did a phenomenal job, this was a huge class to take on for a first timer, and he did it nearly flawlessly. He is also super receptive to student feedback so I am guessing he will read these reviews/take his course evals really seriously to improve next semester. Overall, I expect to get an A in this class, and I didn't too hot on the midterms because of the timing issues, and this is a non-math person speaking. I just felt like I should give this lengthy review if you are anything like me and really concerned about this class, because I really think that Ross is great and this class was good, no regrets taking it with him! Edited to add that this class also uses Python which was really intimidating at first but honestly it is just used as a glorified calculator to compute output, you don't actually really learn any code. He provides the scripts for you and explains how to use them, you're not coding anything yourself. Background in Python is definitely not necessary and he doesn't expect you to be good at it, just be familiar with the commands he runs in class, but it's super easy. It might make more sense if you already understand Python, but is by no means necessary, and learning basic Python functions in this class is honestly useful! TLDR: Take this class with Ross, he's super nice and understanding, very fair/predictable course, this is coming from someone who is very obsessive with schoolwork and needs consistency in a class. Even though the material can just be kind of boring sometimes, this is more of the fact that it's statistics. Ross does a good job at making this a good course for any kind of student. The worked examples he does in class are really useful at reinforcing the material and I felt like the skills learned really built on each other in an easy to learn way."

There are two lectures and two labs a week and you will always have: two post-lecture online quizzes each week, two labs (in groups) per week, one homework assignment a week, and a form of participation clicker questions during lecture. There are 3 exams and a final project as well. The work is doable and it is permitted to work in groups for a lot of it (not quizzes or tests, obviously) but it's really important to start working on assignments as early as you can. Also, the TA grading can suck because it was pretty inconsistent a lot of the time but you can submit regrade requests for most things. The issue with the course were the exams because although the content was fair, it felt like we were never allotted enough time except for the final (which was a fiasco in itself as im sure others have mentioned below).  Ross is a good professor, he knows his stuff, makes himself available, and seems like a nice person. He did go over time in lectures though which I suspect he will get better at going forward. Possible to get an A or A-, but this is a class that you will have to prioritize."

            "text": "This comment will probably be downvoted by all the Ross haters from Spring 2020, but this is a honest review of the professor and the class.\nProfessor Ross got a bad rep this semester because he initially gave us 48 hours to complete the final, but reduced it to the standard 3 hours a week before the final. He did this because some people cheated in the second midterm and giving people more time would only give them a better chance to cheat. Many students had a problem with this (because the second midterm took a long time to complete). However, the final was not as intense as the midterm, and 3 hours was more than enough to complete it.\nOther than that, Prof Ross is a great professor. He's new, so I was hesitant to take his course at first. Regardless, it was a good decision because he was a very chill guy. The transition to online teaching was very handled, and there were very little hiccups (except for the first lab, the rest went well). There are always tons of TAs to help during labs, and Prof Ross and the TAs host a lot of office hours for students to ask questions. If you have any questions, going to office hours is extremely beneficial. We also get extra credit if we answer our peers' questions about statistics on the Collab discussion page. Prof Ross said he'll give everyone 1% extra credit if 90% of the class filled out the course evaluation but less than 90% did it (I believe it was very close to 90 though), and he gave us extra credit anyways. As for the course, I wanted to only major in commerce when I started this course, but I'm also interested in majoring in statistics now. That's how interesting the course can be (if you're even a little interested in statistical analysis). The course is quite challenging, so be prepared to dedicate much more time to it than your other subjects.\nProfessor Ross is a wonderful professor who is very understanding and super helpful if you want help. If you dedicate time to this class, there is no reason you won't get an A."

            "text": "Because of the labs and lectures, this class takes up a lot of time in one's schedule. There's very little beginner instruction about Python, so be prepared to just kinda learn the basics on your own; however, it's not too bad, because Ross posts his scripts, so you can just copy and paste them into Spyder to run.  The material is pretty standard of an Intro Stat course, but exam difficulty was super inconsistent -- the first exam was pretty easy, the second was super hard due to the time constraint, and the last one was pretty in the middle.  The grade breakdown is split between homework, exams, lab reports, a final lab project,  and participation. Honestly, it's quite a heavy workload even though it's a 4 credit class. There's extra credit available for posting in the discussion forums. Ross is a decent, understanding prof and is very helpful during office hours if you go, but I also disapproved of his sudden change of exam policy which is mentioned quite a bit in the other comments. Although it can't excuse everything, it's important to remember that this was Ross's first year teaching this class, so hopefully, it gets better and more organized from here out.  However, overall if you need to take STAT 2120 for a requirement, then Ross is a pretty good choice based on his personality, but get ready for some inconsistencies."

I was quite nervous coming into this class, but after you get a hang of it, it really isn't too bad. At first it is quite overwhelming since there are many different platforms used in this class, but you get used to it pretty quickly. I would say that the biggest thing people complain about for this class is the use of Python/coding, but it really isn't that bad because Professor Ross provides us with the code for most/if not all concepts. Professor Ross states in the beginning of the course that he provides all the resources for students to do well, which I completely agree with. Professor Ross is very organized and gives us a \"to-do list\" of things for each class, which is really helpful. A tip that I would give for anyone taking this class is to utilize Campuswire! Also, Professor Ross is a super understanding professor and he is very considerate of his students. Due to COVID changes, many people struggled on the first exam with technical difficulties, which Professor Ross handled very well and was super open to suggestions on how to improve the class. He is also very considerate of many other things in general (he's very woke, for lack of better words), and you can just tell he is a genuinely good guy.  I really loved having him as a professor.\nFor me personally, the only thing that I didn't particularly enjoy with this class were the labs, but it's just something that is required with the course anyway. I do agree with other posts that the class is kind of a lot of work, but I would say it's pretty easy to get a good grade in this class because many of the lowest grades are dropped so it's worth it in the end."

The labs truly were just information you learned straight from the lecture the day prior, but they taught you how to apply some of the skills you learned in different ways.  The exams were very similar to the labs and you get a page of notes front and back to help you with the formulas.  They were very fair with the averages being in the high 80s. Take this class with Justin, as he is incredibly knowledgeable about statistics and genuinely wants his students to succeed, and this is evident by the fairness of the class.  The last few weeks of the class the topics were very obscure and much harder than the first couple months, but with the page of notes you get on the final, it should be manageable to get an A- in the class at least. #tCFfall22"

He feels like a really helpful fourth year student more than a professor, in a good way. For reference, I went to his office hours two days before the third & final exam, and my man was just running around showing the first question on the exam to people on his laptop. Super cool guy, clearly very passionate about the course material. That course material however.... ranges from boringly meh to mind numbingly incomprehensible.\nIt. Just. Moves. So. Fast.\nThere are two lectures a week, and in these, you can expect Justin Weinstock to absolutely BLAST through 25-40 slides at a speed that will either a.) demolish your hand you're taking notes so fast or b.) leave you in the dust questioning every single concept that was covered. You will absolutely need to put in extra time OUTSIDE of the lectures to understand concepts, because the EXAMS ARE HEAVILY CONCEPTUAL. (GO TO OFFICE HOURS). There are three exams, each noncumulative, so the 'final exam' is really just exam 3. You're also allowed to bring a full 8.5x11 page of notes to each exam, because, to quote Justin; \"Statisticians don't like to memorize\". Okay.\nHere's Justin's grading breakdown25% labs (2x week)15% weekly online collab quizzes (5 questions each, open note, and pretty easy to land 5/5s every time)20% Exam 1 (Easiest content in the course, I landed a 95)20% Exam 2 (I thought it'd be easy again and bombed this one... way harder)20% Exam 3 (Difficulty somewhere between the first and second exam)\nHere's the thing: There are 30 total labs and 12ish total quizzes, but Justin DROPS THE LOWEST SIX LAB GRADES AND LOWEST THREE QUIZ GRADES. I landed a perfect score on both labs and quizzes pretty easily. The easiest way to do this is to GO TO LAB. That may sound crazy, but because labs are simply online gradescope assignments, tons of people just... don't go to lab? If you go to lab, the TAs there will guide you through everything, and you can ace every single one, without fail. That's 25% of the class, right there.\nOverall, while the concepts in Stat 2120 are pretty difficult at times, Justin makes it more than possible to attain an A- if you put in like 4 hours a week. Don't be afraid of this class."

There's ungraded weekly homework for practice, a weekly multiple choice quiz that's only 5 questions (if you do the HW and take the quiz right after then you're set), two weekly labs (ask the TAs about anything you're unsure about and they'll tell you the answer), and three exams worth 20% each that you're allowed to bring a note sheet to (pro tip: write down the interpretations of things like slope/intercept because you might have a short answer section on them). The exams are mostly multiple choice with some True/False and short answer questions. And on top of all that, you can drop the 3 lowest quiz grades and 6 lab grades. Sometimes the lectures are full of info and kind of dry, but Justin is great at explaining concepts and answers questions well whenever students have them. I definitely recommend this class for anyone looking for a good intro stat class!"

STAT 2120, and statistics in general, is much less about your ability to crunch numbers and memorize procedures than it is your ability to work with the intuition the class develops, and Weinstock makes that transition very accommodating and easy to understand. Derivations for most of the content's formulas are written out and you can generally understand each component of the type of analysis you are asked to perform.The content and structure of the course is still the same as the other reviews.

Make sure you do the homeworks strategically, really work with your groups on the labs + ask the TAs for help if you don't understand so that you do well on the quizzes, and study the material as you would normally for every other course and I can personally guarantee you an A-. I had never taken stat before and I did better than people who had taken AP Stat in high school simply by doing my assignments early and strategically (and honorably). I didn't do as well on the final as I had hoped (I had like 4 finals in 3 days. Hey, what can I say, I wanted to go home) so I actually ended up with an A-. If I had gotten one more question right on the final I would've had an A. He grades the statistical study super leniently as well, so just make sure you put in a good effort on that and you'll get a 100.

The class starts off with very basic things that are extremely easy but then it quickly gets harder and harder. The labs were written to take more than the lab period to be prepared to work on them on your own time. They also got very difficult. The homeworks aren't too bad but it is on WebWork which is a terrible program where the answers are calculated using excel. The issue here is you should use your calculator for the homework because you dont get excel on the exam. The exams are not too bad as they generally resemble the practice exams he gives you before the exams. My class had a 75% average on the first exam and a 65% average of the second exam. He will curve the exams individually if the score are bad enough. For our class he deemed at 65% bad enough to curve however he is waiting till the end of the course to see if he actually needs to. In the end, the curve will be to a B like most classes that curve at UVA.\nThe class is 2 midterms, 1 final exam, lab assignments that meet twice a week, and homework that is due weekly.\nIf you can take this class with another professor, do it. If you have take Spitzner, Good luck and enjoy his soundcloud.\nhttp://m.soundcloud.com/dreem-deceever\nI like the ass song the most."

It is one thing to design a \"weed out\" course for pre-comm students; however, this course is taught very poorly and is extremely disorganized. Your grade for certain assignments (labs) is totally arbitrary. Depending on which TA you get, you could get a 100 on a lab or an F, with the same work. Don't even bother asking them what you did wrong or why you didn't get the same grade as someone else with the same work, as they either can't speak English, or are unwilling and unenthusiastic about making sure you understand the material.\nQuestions on the quizzes and exams are not designed to see if you understand the material. Rather, they are full of ambiguous questions, \"gotcha\" questions that try to trick you, or involve using something that was very briefly taught and not emphasized in lecture or the textbook.\nFinally, I'd like anyone reading this to know that your final grade is at the whim of the professor at the end of the semester, and she can arbitrarily decide to not use the curves on the midterms that she announced and that everyone was counting on. She blatantly misled everyone into thinking that the midterms would be curved, as she sent out emails with cutoffs for certain grades (i.e. \"a 12/22 would be considered a C-\"). Well, despite the class average for the second exam being a 68%, at the end of the semester she felt that the scores were too high to curve, so everyone got screwed over.\nI really, wholeheartedly do not think this class is designed to see if the student understands the main statistical concepts taught. Instead, the professor misleads you, the quiz and exam questions try to trick you, and your final grade is extremely arbitrary. This course needs a major overhaul."

Amber does not care whatsoever about her students.

Nobody understands why she did this, and if you try to ask her, she will not respond to you and ignore you. The amount of BS work that is done in this class is over the top. The exams are ridiculously difficult... even if you grasp the concepts, study, practice, and consider yourself a decent \"statistician\" you still probably won't do well, because the questions on the exam are extremely difficult/out there, and then they won't curve your results, so your GPA will take a HUGE hit.

On answer keys and study guides and even lecture slides she would have the wrong information up and would be constantly corrected by students. The problems with this class for ten-fold. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, take any other stat class but this one. Dozens of hours a week are assigned for homework assignments, lab assignments, quizzes, tests and readings, and that's without the optional practice problems which are requisite to even hope for a passing grade in this woefully unorganized and scattered class. No less than 10-15 hours a week will be spent on this class, often with far longer hours that that. I cannot begin to truly explain the incompetency of Professor Tomas and the class itself.

All were harder than the practice exams that he provided. Absolutely no curve, even though the majority of people did terribly on the final and second midterm. Calc II was easier for me than this class. The incompetence of Abdelbaki and the overall lack of communication of how grading will work is pretty frustrating. You will learn the basics of statistics through homework, labs, and projects, but the tests have the potential to tank your GPA.

He's a very good and entertaining person, but not a good lecturer, mainly because he doesn't look like he has got prepared for the class or he has significant knowledge over the topic. In the end, if you're not a stat major, you will memorize question types before the exam, get something around B- and B+, and not learn anything at all."

            "text": "I took it with Maria Ferrara  (her first time teaching the class) over the summer. I'm not a math person but I took and did fairly well in AP Stats in high school. If you took AP, a lot of the class concepts are similar and you can kind of skate by on that knowledge until you get to the latter part of the class where you learn multiple linear regression. I got an A but had to work on statistics basically from getting up to going to bed every single day for 4 weeks. Exams are 40% of the grade and are fair and easier than the labs and practice questions and the averages were high (80-90% I think), but the labs/hw/project are a horrible amount of work and oftentimes you have to do and submit them before you even understand the material they're on. It's \"doable\" to get an A, especially if you are already good at math/stats/Python which I'm not, but I became a sad shriveled husk of a person to do it.  She assigned about 3-4 hours of lecture videos per night which had no business being that long because she sometimes posted Richard Ross's videos on the same content and his are like 30 minutes each when hers are 1 hour and 15 minutes each. 3/4 of my group members dropped out in the first two days of class because she assigned 4 hours of DataCamp Intro to Python assignments on top of watching 4 hours of lecture videos a night and working on 2-3 hour labs in which we needed to use Python but still hadn't learned it yet. The class really does seem to trip over itself because it goes so fast and you are told to do and turn in assignments on concepts you don't yet fully understand. However, the large amount of labs/hw/lecture quizzes/peer reviews pads your grade especially since she drops the lowest few scores in each category and gave a bit of extra credit on the exams. If you really want to or really need to take this class over the summer, I would say do it because I did learn a lot and there was a bit of cushion to boost my grade if I didn't get great marks on some assignments. Professor Ferrara and the TA Brandon were available nearly all hours of the day and made a lot of effort to help answer questions and clarify things for people through multiple office hours and answering questions in the teams chat with fast replies. However  if you are looking for a casual or fun class, I would not recommend this because if you want to stay afloat at all, you need to put in serious effort."

            "text": "I can't lie, this class was harder than expected. It is VERY coding-intensive, so it definitely helps if you come in with a bit of prior R knowledge under your belt. I came from STAT 2020, so I was familiar with the basic commands, but the course progresses from the basics to advanced statistics quite fast, so make sure you don't fall behind. Here's the rundown:\nThe workload: There are online lectures that we are expected to watch before every class (tbh, it was kind of a waste of time imo and I found more value in just reading the comments left on the R file with the code on the lectures). There is a coding assignment every week that goes with the content covered in the online lectures for that week. They are auto graded on Gradescope, so you can see what test cases you pass and fail. Some of the test cases are hidden, so I would recommend checking with the TA before submitting! In addition to that, there are daily assignments for every class. These are kinda annoying and they're due at the end of the day, so don't forget to submit them (there are no drops!). At the end of the semester, there is a project consisting of 4 \"modules\", and this is just an extended version of the weekly homework except it's more involved.\nThe exams: There are three programming quizzes in the first half of the semester. STUDY FOR THEM! He actually requires you to know what each command does and you would also need to able to spot mistakes in buggy code and suggest improvements! These are worth a pretty good chunk of your grade and they are not easy, so be prepared! You get a one page cheat sheet for each quiz, so take advantage of that too!\nThe professor: Prof. Brown is chill l and that's pretty much all I can say about him. He was just kinda there for the lectures and didn't really lecture unless the whole class was stuck on a problem on the daily assignment. However, I do like that he was open to feedback on the grading and how to improve it. Also, he's pretty strict about turning in things on time, so don't try to turn things in late!\nThere is a neat good curve at the end of the semester, so don't fret if you don't do as well on the quizzes or if you forget a couple daily assignments. You will be pretty R-savvy by the end of this course, so it is kind of a necessary evil if you're a stats major/minor, but if this is not required for you, I wouldn't recommend it."

Homeworks aren't too bad either -- but they are in Gradescope, so MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THEM. I missed one, knocked me down to a B+ from A-. Also, programming quizzes aren't awful if you have a good cheat sheet. Project modules are made out to be time-consuming, but honestly they took me about 6 hours total (and you have semester-long access, so easy.) It's a fun class, but you're probably taking it because it's required, so that doesn't matter to you. Try to knock it out early if you can, since you can sneak into the course in your first/second year!"

If you're confused by what \"Data to Knowledge\" means, you won't clear your confusion by taking the class. The first half of the class was memorizing R code (which is a bit useful I guess), but why are we doing this when programming is a prereq and more than half of the kids took STAT 1601? The second half of the class is a weird review of STAT 2120 mixed in with some nonparametrics . But I already took nonparametrics and why are we reviewing 2120 when it's a prereq?\nSecond point, Taylor Brown was ineffective at best. A harsher reading of him in this class? He was unprepared and didn't give a fudge. He used flipped classroom teaching but used another professor's videos from 2020. Lecture was just doing problems for the daily assignment, and he was mad annoying. He would rarely tell the class the right answer when we reviewed problems at the end of class, he would just pontificate, shuffle through some R code, go on some tangents, and some more BS. I just find it hard to learn if I show up to class and don't get correct feedback.\nAll that being said, I got the grade I wanted and I genuinely like Brown as a person.

The homeworks and the quizzes are by far the most difficult components of the class. The homework can take upwards of 5-6 hours to finish if they’re difficult but reviewing with a group helps a lot. The quizzes were really hard for me due to my lack of programming knowledge but you can scrape by if you dedicate a fairly sizable amount of time to studying each notes section.  Professor Martinent is very lenient with the clicker questions so you can miss a bunch and still pull a 100 for the final clicker grade. The project may seem a little intimidating but the rubric she gives you is very straightforward and simple so if you follow that, you’re guaranteed to do well.

While I didn't think Martinet was the most engaging professor I have ever had, she is very caring and always willing to help out. The only thing to be concerned about as far as the coding aspect is the quizzes, which there are only 3 of. Since there are only 3 and they're collectively worth 15% of the grade, if you're a little shaky on the methods, I highly recommend going back and re-doing the homeworks beforehand to get some practice.

Both are clearly laid out on rubrics, just make sure to find good data ahead of time.Clickers are not very difficult, and there are enough that everyone should reach the buffer point.The programming quizzes are so hard. Paper coding is rough for anyone, much less a non-CS major. So much code is covered each class that without a lot of study the quizzes can tank you. That said I got an A with about a 66 quiz average so not all is lost, but put in a good few hours prepping for these.The homeworks are, well, a pain in the ass. They are very helpful to learn the material, and tend to be pretty straightforward. However, as the semester goes on the coding becomes much harder, and there are often \"leaps of thinking\" needed to get a good score. There are TA office hours, but queues are long. Be sure to make a few friends to bounce code off of, otherwise you will spend hours a week in a stuffy room waiting for TA help.\nLearning Monte Carlo simulation is cool, and it is a good intro class.

But when I took this class, it made me realize why everyone hates the statistics department here. A few of my friends who took it said it was easy, but they had Caitlin Steiner. Also a lot of people say its no work, which is simply untrue if you are new to R.\nHere's the run down:\n1. Heather Cook is by far the least qualified instructor I have EVER had. She reads straight off slides (when I say straight, I mean she just looks at the slides and reads them word by word). She is NO help during office hours (She will say things like \"try it yourself\" and \"what do you think?\"). She seems to have no knowledge of the course at all. I think the only reason she is even teaching this course is because this semester there was a super high demand to get into the course, so they had to find another instructor to make two sections.\n2. The notes are no longer posted on collab. This semester, they purposely took out the filled in powerpoint slides, so you have to go to class and take notes. Obviously, this is expected from all classes but some of the slides have blocks of text which make it nearly impossible to write down. (I ended up having to take pictures of half of the lecture notes DURING class, and it was hard as hell to study because my notes were so disorganized - some pictures and some handwritten.\n3. The grading is unfair. My friend lost 20% on a project because ONE line of code was wrong. This led to other parts of his code to be wrong, and because other parts were wrong he got 0% on an entire question of the project. I also lost 25% off one of my homeworks because I misinterpreted one of the questions on the homework, did EXTRA work, and plotted one thing wrong (Which was a result of two incorrect lines of code).\nThis class made me very sad. I'm currently enrolled in the class actually, but it made me so angry that I had to make a review."

This class makes UVA look very bad and makes you question what you are spending 20k per semester on. It also has arbitrary and random grading designed to be impossible because the instructions are to vague to adequately meet the rubrik. For your own sake, save yourself."

It almost feels right just to say this is the worst class ever and leave it, but I'll state my case anyway.\n1. Heather Cook is simply an incompetent professor. Period. She seems like a nice enough person and in office hours wasn't terrible, but she could care less about the class. She simply read off the other professors slides during class (and it was clear that this was her first time reading them). She often didn't know details about our assignments and thus couldn't answer our questions, and her lecture style is dry as sand.2. Grading: I do not know how one could do well in this class. The assignments are vague and not instruction is given on how the assignments are graded. I knew R coming in so none of the material was really new to me, but even I couldn't get past the hieroglyphics that were most of our assignments (and as mentioned above, Heather didn't know anything about the assignments either). The recommended textbook was a savior because a lot of the homework questions came right out of it. Don't expect a good grade in this class regardless of how well you've done in MUCH harder classes. You will lose the most trivial and petty points on assignments and will end up with a mediocre grade for what should be an easy A class.\nOverall, this class was immense frustration and I really feel as though I have nothing to show for it. Please don't take this class, regardless of how easy or interesting it sounds."

First of all, the class has the incorrect prerequisites on sis. The Statistics Department recommends either STAT1601, STAT1602, or having taken both an intro stats class and intro programming class before. SIS only lists an intro stats class. For those who have coded in R software before, this class would be easy; for those who have coded at all (in Python) I would say this class is a little harder but still understandable; if you have not coded at all, then this class is a difficult. Professor Ross skims through the material at a pace and with coding jargon that I could not comprehend (Never coded before). This is not a stats class, this is a coding class. R is not insanely difficult, and I've managed to get by, by spending a long time on the homework and looking online for how to do things in R. The quizzes are hard for me but there are only 3 and the quiz category is 15% of your grade (so each is 5% while each individual homework assignment is 4%). There are no tests or midterms or final in the class (thank god) but there is a project. Outside of lecture the class work is 1-4 hours I'd say (depending on your understanding of R). This is not an insane amount. Overall the class is low stress, but I do think lectures are frustrating, can be useless, and need to be better organized. And if they aren't going to require a coding prerequisite, they need to give a better introduction to R. If you want to learn how to do more things in R, take this class. If you want an introduction to R, take the STAT 1600 level class. If you want to learn more about actual statistics, this is not the class for you. Overall I don't regret taking the class. The work is manageable and I love that there are no tests. The homework is possible (I would recommend going to TA office hours even if you feel good about you're homework because I learned a lot in office hours)."

Graded on a slight curve because the class isn't easy. I sometimes shy away from office hours, just because I don't want to feel stupid because professors can be disparaging at times.

This was mainly because of how Professor Weinstock does an amazing job explaining the concepts step by step. He doesn't even stutter that often during lectures. Despite this, Professor Weinstock genuinely is a really cool guy, and he's really chill. Two of my friends that I met in the class and I have some nice small talk with him every morning. He holds pretty frequent office hours, and they're really helpful because he is genuinely looking forward to helping you succeed in the class. Additionally, the structure of the class was brilliant. There were three major exams with no cumulative final, with each being 25% of your final grade. The last 25% was from the lecture quiz grades, of which 6 of your lowest were dropped. Homework was provided, but not required. It was mostly a tool to help review for exams and just to get that extra practice in. They usually had 1-3 problems, with 1-2 being more common. Often, they had multiple parts. There were also very detailed homework solutions that were all posted very early in advance. Additionally, Professor Weinstock handwrites comments on your exams and hands them back to you, and not only is the handwriting absolutely beautiful, but he really helps break down what you got wrong. Overall, the homework and feedback I received were incredibly helpful for me. If I had to, I think I could definitely still get an A in the class if it was all virtual. I think this just goes to show how great of a professor Justin Weinstock is. And by the way, it's really hard to fit everything that the professor does really well in just this chunk of text, but Professor Weinstock really provides everything you need to succeed in that class. Oh, and have I mentioned that he barely stutters or use filler words?"

He posts the annotated slideshows on a one drive, and he can send recorded lectures if you ask, so you can skip if you want. The grade was comprised of 40% HW, 30% for 2 midterms, and 30% on the final. The first midterm was brutal, but it was curved a lot. The second midterm was take home, which made it easier, but I still find it kind of difficult. The final was also take home, and this was definitely the easiest of the 3 exams. The homework being 40 percent is nice. The homework is textbook problems and it's easy to get help on them if needed. Not a bad class, just boring sometimes. I actually loved the professor for how nice he was and how much he loved the topic but I know some others did not like him. #tCFF23"

He's helpful when you seek out help, which I highly recommend. The homework can be a bit tedious but with effort you can ace them. His grade cutoff was a 92 for an A, so pretty generous in that regard. And despite the dry lectures, he tells a couple funny jokes here and there which me and my friends enjoyed. Cool guy, good vibes, but not very engaging class."

Conner is a super nice guy, I think his intentions are in the right place, but he is an awful teacher. It seemed like a situation in which he is very knowledgeable but does not understand how to diffuse that knowledge to his students. He is a grad student, and I definitely think he can become a great teacher one day. But I would strongly not recommend taking this statistics with him. Our grade was made up of 5 hw(15%). and 2 midterms (20%) and a cumulative final that was 45%. There was no prep for any of the test (besides the hw you had already turned in). Yeah, not much more to say, definitely not ideal, It has probably been my least enjoyable class (and I had Charlotte Hoops the first semester she taught Foundations of Commerce), not in terms of content, because I think the material could be super interesting if taught in the right way but just in terms of how it was taught. Also, I only put a 4 for difficulty not because it should have been super difficult, we just lacked practice for the midterms.\nAlso, if you're reading this, and you think this is a one-off comment this class won't be to bad, I would reconsider, I think most of the class would agree with the sentiment I am writing here."

The homeworks were manageable, there were sometimes tricky questions but Connor was happy to help during office hours and the lowest grade was dropped. The midterms weren't horrible, but it was hard to know how to study for them and there was always a question or two that tripped me up. You're allowed a cheat sheet for each of the midterms and 2 sheets for the final which is helpful. My biggest problem with this class was the final. I used the homeworks to study but still ended up lost on several questions which was frustrating given how heavily it was weighted. Lectures seemed to mostly just be the notes being rewritten on the board, so I wouldn't stress about going. Overall, I liked Connor but not his teaching style and wish the workload/grade distribution was more spread out through the semester.\n#tCFfall22"

Each class was just him rewriting the notes on the board and he never really explained past what was already on the online notes. The homework was relatively easy and free points, but was only 15% of our grade. For the two midterms, that were both weighted 20%, the averages were mid-Cs. He didn't really tell us what to study for the midterms other than the homework, but we were allowed to use cheat sheets on the exams, which was pretty helpful. The final was 45% of our grade and we didn't get much of a review for it, which made it pretty difficult because it covered a lot of content. The questions weren't incredibly difficult, but there would always be a few tricky ones that weren't really covered in the notes. If you take this class, you should expect to teach yourself the material because his lectures aren't the best, but it is doable if you put the work in. Hopefully in the future Connor can teach the class with more structure and support.\n#tCFfall22"

Each HW only took an absolute max of 5 hrs maybe.The first midterm was kind of difficult, and he curved the exam a good bit. the second midterm, although the content seems harder, was actually easier and had much higher averages. The final was pretty representative of the whole course. The final was curved a little bit. I should add, the first 2/3rds of the course is probability and the last 1/3rd is linear algebra (with only a little emphasis on the theoretical stuff). I would also highly recommend to do the practice exams since the actual exams are similar.Honestly, overall mostly an easy class and it shouldn't be extremely hard to get a form of an A, although it takes some work."

My best piece of advice for his class specifically is to GO TO THE EXAM REVIEW CLASS PERIODS. he is REALLY descriptive of what you need to know, and it's honestly so helpful. To review for exams, I just redid a lot of the practice problems we used in class and the homework problems. It was really helpful and I never got lower than an A on any of the exams. There are three midterms and you drop the lowest one. Overall, if you are a statistics major and you are worried about this class, dont worry at all. Take it with Yifan and you'll be set."

Really hard to pay attention when he turns and talks to the board, skips through important slides and spends more time doing proofs that we are not being tested on rather than going over problems we might see on exams. Be prepared to do your own preparation for exams as you do not do much practice in class. You get a cheat sheet for the exam so that is helpful but you have to know how to apply the statistics. Knowing how to do integrals is crucial for the course, don't really go over them in class but you are expected to do them and show the work. Homework is from the textbook but you don't have to read the textbook as lectures are a carbon copy of the textbook."

He let us have two double-sided sheets for the first two exams, and for the final, let us have four-double sided sheets. He provides calculations for distributions so you don't have to write them out by hand. He provides his notes, online, so you don't even have to come to class necessarily. His tests are definitely a lot easier than the other professors, when you compare the two professors (James Lee was the other) exams.\nOnto why I don't like David. I don't respect him as a professor, really. By mid-November I just stopped showing up because I realized all you need are his notes to show up. He uploads his notes a few hours before class begins so you can follow it during class, so it's quite useless to come to class. He makes so many mistakes, especially when he's lecturing in real time. He is also so, so awkward. Whenever a student asks a question he honest to god just cannot answer them because he has no idea how to, but also because I don't think he even understands the question itself (although 100% of the time they're not difficult questions to understand...). Even his notes have mistakes sometimes which I don't understand why. It's just kind of useless to go to class or even be in class which is why I stopped go. Also, he's so strict on the homework for some reason - even if you get the right answer he'll deduct points if he notices even the slightest error in your work (I wrote 10 instead of .10 and I got two points off on the homework).\nTake what you will from this review. It's really not that bad taking the class with David just sort of... cringe and embarrassing. I would recommend him though because he is a lot more lenient and easier than the other professors. He added three points to our first exam at the end of the semester to \"help everyone out\", which is a plus."

I wrote this review primarily so I could share the following resources for understanding the linear algebra section of the course – these videos combined are less than an hour long, and while they don't give you the actual algorithms/maths to solve the problems, they will help you understand the concepts 100x better. Learning linear algebra w/ no prior background in the subject from just the lectures and notes felt like that scene in Harry Potter where Harry tries to push his cart through the magic pole into Platform 9 3/4 and keeps just running into a brick wall; watching these videos helped me \"cross over\" into actually UNDERSTANDING linear algebra concepts like matrix multiplication and made solving the problems in class 100x easier.\nVECTORS, VECTOR ADDITION, AND SCALAR MULTIPLICATION: https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSsVECTOR \"SPAN,\" BASIS VECTORS AND LINEAR INDEPENDENCE: https://youtu.be/k7RM-ot2NWYMATRICES: https://youtu.be/kYB8IZa5AuEMATRIX MULTIPLICATION: https://youtu.be/XkY2DOUCWMU\nThese videos literally saved my life (OK, they figuratively saved my life, they literally saved my A)"

If you showed up to lecture, you were prepared to do the work for the course. If he ever assigned a trickier problem for homework, he always was available after class or in office hours and sometimes extended deadlines when we were behind schedule. He also was willing to implement curves if a certain assignment (including exam) average was low, but our class never had to have assignments curved.\nThis is one of those classes where if you show up to lecture, really take time to complete and understand the homeworks, and ask questions, your grade will reflect your work."

Do note that the exams aren't curved though. Also lots of opportunities for bonus points. Definitely take this class with Sam (if he teaches it again!) #tCFS24"

However, if you take this class with Sam, don't worry too much about your grade. He WILL give you more than enough opportunities to get an A in this class. You will have to put in some work, but he will help you understand the material and do well. Grab as many bonus points as you can!You will need to read the textbook to actually understand the content well. Lectures are moderately useful but he posts the recordings and notes online, so lectures aren't required to attend.There were 5 HWs, the first one was quite long, but the rest got shorter. The short quizzes are fine, the exams are tough but you can prepare for them. Take advantage of OH, bonus points, and ask Sam any and all questions and you will do well in this class.If you're a stat major who hasn't taken this class yet, take it with Sam if you want to feel less anxious about your grade!"

It is hard to imagine a class having a nicer format while still being considered a class.  The only formal homework was short multiple choice quizzes (of which several were dropped); we were allowed to make multiple formula sheets for each exam (all of which were grading forgivingly); and multiple class days were designated as \"discussion sections,\" where the TA would just work through practice problems.  These factors, among others, such as Xiwei's slow lecture style, resulted in a class to which it was hard to dedicate oneself seriously.  Success on the exams largely came down to applying mathematical skills (largely calculus) in context, so depending on your comfort level and experience, varying levels of practice (beyond the ungraded homeworks) may be necessary.  I've heard that 3120 is much more challenging with other professors (like Ross), but if you either have to take this class or are looking for an easier math elective, Dr Tang is not a bad choice for lightening the blow.\n#tCFF23"

The content that is covered is quite useful, with the class split generally into three parts: a unit to review probability concepts, a unit to discuss estimators and how to characterize estimators, and a unit to discuss confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. Thus, content-wise, I highly recommend this course for any students remotely interested in statistics, probabilistic mathematics, or economics (this course could even prove helpful to those intending to pursue careers in finance and consulting, or even more generally business).\nThis course's popularity undoubtedly stems from its minimal difficulty. In terms of the structure of the course, grades were calculated as follows: 25% for weekly quizzes (which were virtual, open-note, and quite easy) and 25% for each midterm (there were three midterms with no cumulative final). Professor Tang provided many opportunities for extra-credit as well and he was generally quite generous with grading. It is not hard to succeed in this course; it seems one can dedicate only a few hours of studying for each midterm and easily achieve a good grade."

He posts short videos to watch before each class, followed by practice problems that take a huge leap beyond what is explained in the videos. Then in class, he has students present these practice problems instead of explaining them himself or providing any instruction of his own. His exams are unreasonably difficult considering he essentially does not teach the entire semester, and the student is expected to learn it all on their own. He is never timely in responding to questions on EdStem, and always posts slides, quiz and problem solutions late, as if he just couldn't be bothered to do something so simple. The only positive thing I can say is that he gave 6% back on the first exam in the form of extra credit. Otherwise, I honestly can't comprehend that a school with the prestige of UVA allows Ross to teach such a pivotal class to the Statistics major. It's honestly a shame, because the material could be quite engaging if you enjoy math, but he completely ruins it. I just feel bad for all the stats majors in the future who will be forced to endure this guy. Maybe UVA will come to their senses and move him to a less important class.

The T/F can be tricky, but if you have the lecture slides with you, you should be fine.\nOne last piece of advice: Watch the pre-recorded lectures.

He's also super approachable and genuinely seems to care about students. The homeworks were reasonable and the exams were fair.

Taylor was not the world's most skilled lecturer, but he was not the worst I have ever had and he was pretty attractive;).  Your grade comes from 3-4 extremely challenging homework sets, 2 midterms, and a final.  The midterms and final were very hard (and very proof heavy-I don't think there was a single actual number on our final), but he curved them.  Overall, I would not recommend this class to anyone other than stats majors, but if you are a stats major who is required to take it, it will suck no matter who you are with. I didn't mind Taylor that much until the asshole didn't round my 82.88 up so I got a B- instead of a B."

If you are planning on majoring in Stats you should take it sooner than later because it covers all the \"big ideas\". There is a lot of math involved (as the name would imply) and a few proofs you will have to know for the exams, but not too bad if you carefully review the slide decks, attend class, and go to office hours if you have questions. The book isn't really needed other than for doing the HW problems, you can learn what you need from the slide decks. Professor Keenan is a great choice for this class because his exams are fair and graded quickly. Also you can bring a formula sheet so you don't really need to memorize any long formulas. He is also extremely knowledgeable about statistics so there isn't any question he can't answer. He cares about his students and does a good job explaining complex material. 6 Problem sets, 2 midterms, and a final determine your grade."

Learn from the textbook for this course; it's all you need to succeed.\nThe course itself is not that hard. If you did okay in probability and intro stats, this course will not be that bad. Exams are relatively straightforward and curved; problem sets are all out of the book. If you are decent at math/stats, Keenan is probably one of the easier professors to take it with. The material is mostly just proofs of things in stats, lots of calculus and probability, it's all very theoretical. Don't expect lecture to be useful to you."

The first half of the semester is ridiculous, but surprisingly the midterm was fairly easier than the homeworks. After the midterm (there's only one), a lot of the stuff we learned was basic stat from STAT 2120 (e.g. hypothesis testing, confidence intervals) with some expansion on some topics. Despite the easier material the second half, the final was quite difficult. The good thing about this class  is that for the midterm, you get one cheat sheet and two for the final. Miao doesn't do a good job reviewing the material before the tests though; he simply goes over the powerpoints again at a faster rate. Unfortunately, this class can't be avoided if you're a stat major but if you wanna avoid doing a lot of proofs on the exams, you should take it with him. Otherwise take it with someone better who can actually teach the material. I basically learned everything from reading the textbook; I hardly paid attention to his lectures."

The class was incredibly structured in the sense of homeworks, mini projects, and material. The exams on the other hand. She gave us an open-note midterm (somehow I still did terribly on that) and then changed our open-note final to a huge final project. In the end, the final project ended up saving my grade but she assigned it very impulsively and I don't know if she's going to implement it next semester. She teaches straight from the textbook, and homework is also straight from the textbook so definitely have that. The homework is tiring and long, it wears your spirit down so definitely try to get a hold of a Chegg account in some way, shape, or form. Also, I would recommend taking this class with friends because when you do mini-projects/homeworks, having someone to check your numbers and analysis with is extremely helpful. There is a mini-project due for every chapter and you're assigned a group for the first like 3 or 4, and then you get to pick your group. MAKE SURE YOU PICK A GOOD GROUP. The second half of mini-projects is significantly harder than the first half and if you have a terrible group then it's going to be hard. The hype part about this class is all the extra credit Krista gives out for going to talks and writing reflections -- take full advantage of all extra credit opportunities, they saved my grade. Learning SAS was fun, and you apply it a lot but a lot of it is copying and altering bits of her code that she posts. It might have been cool to do an independent SAS project to learn more skills in SAS because I feel like we barely scratched the surface, but I liked what I did learn. Material isn't too hard either, just read the textbook."

I agree that the case studies (4 mini projects worth 20% of your grade) and homework (6 assignments worth 25% of your grade) could be a bit tedious, but they were graded pretty fairly-- the case studies were graded by her and were generally pretty easy to get an A on, the homeworks however took a while to be graded and seemed to be graded sort of subjectively-- probably my only critique of the course. Our first exam was open book and online, plus had 10 possible extra credit points... how people managed to not get an A honestly surprised me because the subject matter was not very difficult. In this course, you will have to get familiar with coding in SAS, something that scared me because I had little coding experience. However (contrary to what many people seem to be saying) she presented it in a relatively easy-to-follow manor, and even released her own solutions to the practice problems involving SAS so we could go over it after lecture... honestly seemed pretty nice. If you keep up with the coding as you go, it won't be hard. Honestly, if you remember proc reg you'll be fine lol. Overall, I would recommend taking this course. It introduces some really interesting regression topics and opens your eyes to the wider world of statistics."

I admit that there are 4 case studies during the semester and a final project. But the exam are open-book and she reviewed some important questions that may be shown on the exam with us. So, I say it is hard for you to not get a 90/100 higher on exams. As I knew so far, she tries to change her syllabus and make this course more interesting and less hard for students. A cutoff is 95%, but she gives extra credit for finishing course evaluation. For the Fall 2018 semester, the A is actually 93%. If you put in effort on your group case studies and write well notes for exams, you at least will get an A-. I believed most of our class was  A."

She tries her very best to make a sometimes dull subject interesting, and quite frankly I really like her. She is very helpful and extremely fair. Honestly, this class is really easy because Krista really wants everyone to succeed. I never read the textbook and found that I could be successful by just attending lectures. The HW sets are also very helpful, especially with regard to how to use SAS.  The two exams are pretty easy because she gives you practice for them and you can use a cheat sheet. Additionally, she grades the projects very leniently. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone with any interest in statistics/economics/business/any field that is highly quantitative/analytical because it is easy and the material taught is extremely applicable to the real world."

The class is organized so that you have a HW assignment and a group project for every chapter, but she gives you time in class to start the project and both are graded leniently so they are a nice grade booster. There is also an individual final project, a midterm, and a final. The midterm was too long, but she recognized that and curved everyone up 6 points, which I really appreciated.

Homeworks are graded ambiguously because Taylor Brown does not even know the answers to the own questions he gives on the homework. Prof uses pre recorded lectures from Holt, and I am assuming he uses the previous professor's hws as before because of how unclear he is on the expectations and wording. He makes us argue for points back on slack and intentionally challenges us in our justification when his own wording is at fault, which can come across as condescending even if that isnt his intention. You will lose points in this class due to reading comprehension of his intentionally ambiguous questions. The homeworks themselves are not that difficult but some do take a few hours to complete, but he does give you from Saturday to Thursday to finish them. The TAs are helpful and it helps to take this class with friends because Prof does allow collaboration on assignments (within the limits of the honor code of course). Overall, this course is kind of an easy B+/A- if you are good with python (for context, I didnt watch a single lecture because the lecture scripts are sufficient) and don't mind that participation, attending class, is 5% of your final grade."

I won't lie, it was tempting some days to take the easy route and just bag the A, but I do think that the content covered in this class is EXTREMELY useful in statistics and data science, so it's in your best interest to actually get a good grasp on them. Grades are composed of weekly homeworks, weekly quizzes, and exams. He goes over the homework in class before they are due, so they are fairly easy to score full points on. Weekly quizzes are online and have unlimited attempts, so they are also free gimme points. Exam is probably the \"hardest\" part of the class, but there are only two and you can drop one, so if you do well on the midterm, you don't need to take the final! He also offers a ton of extra credit throughout the semester so you can offset a mid score on the exam, but he's very lenient when it comes to grading so it's not difficult to score well on the exam even if you're not super prepared.\nSam is probably the most personable professor I have had at UVA. He sets the class up for his students' success and puts in A LOT of work to make the class helpful for us. He's also just a chill guy -- super easy to talk to and always encourages feedback.

I highly recommend taking this course with him if you haven't had him yet. I took this as a 4th-year and wished that I had taken a course with him earlier after being in the course.\nSyllabus: 10 HWs (each worth 7 points, drop one), 6 Quizzes (each worth 1 point, drop one), 3 Exams/Project (each worth 16 points, one drop)\nOverview: The course is point based not percentage based. For example, if you earn a full-score on the first homework to start the semester, you have guaranteed 7% of your grade. I wish I had realized how beneficial this is to your success because it would have reduced a lot of stress about the course early on in the semester.\nFor homework, they are writing code to return answers to questions that revolve around manipulating datasets with the methods learned in class. They can be tricky, but if you commit time to them, you can earn a 100% on every single one.\nQuizzes are on Canvas and range from 4-5 questions focused on recent class unit concepts. You have multiple attempts to earn a 100%, so you should earn full points without any issue.\nThe exams can be HARD. However, this should not prevent you from taking the course. This is why I am going to give the course a hard rating, not because it is hard to earn a good grade. If you earn a 90-100, you receive an A as your final grade. Due to the point scale being in place, if you gain a perfect score on the homework assignments and quizzes you will already be at 68 points already, which requires that you earn 22 more on exams to earn an A. On each exam and just throughout the class you can earn numerous bonus points which reduces the exam pressure even further.\nFor exams, you can either do a third exam or a final project which requires the comprehensive use of Python to explore a research question that you have. Personally, I had ~70% average on the first two exams, knew I already ended the course with an A and was able to use my final exam as a drop (didn't even take it). However, if you wanted the opportunity to complete a project and are passionate about showcasing your coding skills and research in a portfolio or Github, this course is a great opportunity to do so.\nI recommend this course to anyone that wants to learn more about the Python language. You won't regret it taking the course with Sam."

I think they are offering this course since Python is language that is easy to learn and has useful statistical libraries that might help you in the real world.  There were many bumps since it was the first semester Holt was teaching this new course, such as extensions and general expectations. I wish he can make the course better by making the homework questions much more clearer or by giving out the answers(output) first so that we know what we should expect in our coding, just like how it is done in CS 1110.  I don't know when this will be offered again, but if you want to learn coding in Python and do statistical analysis, this class is for you.\nIf you have experience with Python from CS 1110, it is pretty simple for the first month or so. You will be better prepared than anyone else in the class. Taking CS 1110 before taking this class helped me immensely. I recommend taking CS 1110 first.  After the first month, the class picks up the pace. You learn how to use statistical libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, DataFrames, and etc. You use these libraries to clean data, analyze data, and perform calculations by writing out code in Python. The last two months are quite challenging since you have to deal with massive data sets and the questions that Holt makes up is sometimes unclear. He is open ended in how you interpret the questions as the semester moves on, but as I said, it would be better if he made the questions more concise and clearer.\nOverall,  it is very similar to a CS course--homework is all coding and the exam is reading code and writing code. Pretty good class and you learn a lot but there are some homework that is insane and take a lot of time. Be ready to stare at the computer for hours which composes of looking at the given data sets, try different things by writing small bits of code and testing it.\nTwo midterm exams. The best way to prepare for exams are to look at his sample questions that are released before the exam. The exam is very similar to the sample questions. Make sure you know how to do all the sample questions, then you will at least get a B. There is a final group project. It really comes down how well your group is determined but I honestly am not a fan of group projects for some reason since I like to be in control of all the code and analysis. It's a personal thing, but I hope he gets rid of the final project with a final exam or move it to an earlier date where you don't have to be obsessed and stressed with the project and other final exams.\nOverall, its not a bad course. I learned a lot. I had experience with Python in CS 1110 and did well in CS 1110, so it was easier to pick up the material and coding part. I may be a bit biased since I loved Python as my first programming language, but I loved learning how to use statistical libraries in Python by applying loops, conditionals that I learned in CS 1110  for doing statistical analysis. If you do not like coding, you might figure out that you should drop the course early on. It is very easy for the first month, but if you are struggling I recommend dropping it since you should be  aware that the homework is not that simple as was in the first month since it involves a lot of effort and time to look at data sets and perform calculations by writing code."

Python is a super easy language to learn (coming from a guy with no coding experience before this class) and Professor Holt is a diamond in the rough in the Statistics Department. Course is 12 assignments, no exams and no final. You can work with others on the assignments but it is best to try to do the assignments on your own before getting help from others. It's basically like solving a puzzle, which I really enjoyed, and nothing is overly complex. One assignment towards the end of the course will be very tough, so be ready for that. Overall though, I decided to take this class on a whim and it ended up being my favorite class of the semester. Your grade will be exactly what you put into the course, but expect to work a fair amount to get that A. DON'T USE FOR LOOPS UNLESS HE SAYS YOU CAN USE FOR LOOPS. After like assignment 4 or 5, he bans for loops unless in very specific circumstances. Don't try to argue with him if you use one and he docks points. Get used to not using for loops, groupby and masking are honestly easier and faster. This is usually an issue with people who don't go to lecture, so go to lecture. Also, Professor Holt has people turn in assignments on Wednesdays in class. A significant number of people every week would come into the class halfway through Professor Holt's lecture, walk to the front of the class to turn in the assignment, then straight-up leave the class immediately. Not only is this fundamentally rude, it got on Professor Holt's (everyone else's) nerves. So, do yourself a favor and wait until the end of the class to turn it in if you absolutely need to turn in the assignment late for some reason. He's super chill about it and won't mark you off points. In fact, he'll respect you more."

Holt posts all his notes online and if you have taken a previous coding course (CS1100 perhaps) you will certainly not need to go to class everyday as we don't learn anything that challenging.  All in all, I can't recommend this course enough I learned a lot and for any aspiring data analyst the applications of python that this class teaches are very useful."

This course is flipped classroom so there are recorded lectures to watch and then weekly python assignments due every Wednesday. If you have no questions or issues with the homework then there is no reason to go to class. Basically, you teach it to yourself especially if you come in with python knowledge it is very easy to figure out on your own. This would be a hard class without having a data science/python/coding background. I learned a lot about pandas and the different tools available. You can go to Lee's or Holt's sections (at least for fall 2022) to ask questions and there is separate office hours. There are no exams in this course!"

The class, however, was not fun. This course is all about getting used to Python and it really has very little stats in it. We did one week on using statistical modeling packages but it was more about the syntax in Python than the actual model itself. The entire grade is based on 13 homeworks (previous years had 14 with one drop.. we did not) that are graded automatically in Gradescope. For the first few assignments, your grade is just published with your submission, so you know how you did. But after a couple weeks, they started hiding our grades. So there was really know way to know what your grade was or what you should change. Our class had a really difficult time with this and they ended up publishing the grades again for the last two assignments. No in-person lecture, all the teaching is done via recorded lectures with an attached script. The lecture block is used for office hours. All in all, the class is definitely useful and I think it certainly helped my python skills. But it was really annoying."

I learned a lot about what goes into effective graphs and how to use R and R-adjacent tools to create them, which will definitely be very useful in the professional world. The coursework itself was generally not that difficult - there is, on average, one homework and one classwork assignment per week, with an occasional extra assignment or mini-project thrown in. There's also a final dashboard-type project, which you do NOT want to procrastinate on, as others have mentioned.\nMy only major gripe with this course is the grading system - Professor Ross uses \"specifications grading\", which in theory means that an assignment either gets a 1 or a 0 depending on whether said assignment passes \"specs\". In practice this basically means \"A or nothing\" for every single assignment, with the \"specs\" in question being very vague and subjective. Graphs and charts aren't an exact science, which makes it hard to determine what \"passing\" actually looks like in practice unless you attend office hours consistently. I think most people end up doing pretty well in this course regardless, but it was a bit frustrating trying to get my redo tokens and everything to work out along the way, which could have been avoided if a regular percentage grading system were used."

Professor Ross cares so much about his students and I genuinely believe that the material taught in this class is some of the most instantly applicable content at UVA. There is no coding requirement to take this class but I knew a few people who came into it with no knowledge of R and struggled a lot. I would recommend taking an intro class or at least having a background in Python or some other language because the assignments definitely assume a base level of understanding. Specs grading is very reasonable and Prof. Ross gives you opportunities to earn more \"tokens\" that allow you to redo assignments you didn't meet specifications on.\nYou need to go class every Friday because there are weekly in class assignments that are required. If you make sure to put in the effort of attending and paying attention in class on Monday and Wednesday, these ICAs are pretty easy. There is homework almost every single week that takes 1-2 hours. Sometimes it's coding, other times it's reading and a reflection. You can use AI sources for everything in this class (ChatGPT is good for simpler assignments, ClaudeAI is good for more complex code). Make sure to start your final project a month in advance. For me, finding and cleaning my data and creating the first two visualizations took the longest. Because I started earlier, I was able to go to office hours before they got super busy and get my questions answered.\nICAs, homework, and plot projects are graded as 1 (pass specs) or 0 (does not meet specs). The final project is graded as a 2, 1, or 0. To get an A, you need to pass 13/15 ICAs, 9/10 Homeworks, 2/2 plot projects, and get a 2 on the final project. If you meet everything else but get a 1 on the final project, you will end up with a B. There is no + grading (i.e. no A+, B+, etc) but there is - grading if you are 1 item short (i.e. if you pass specs on 12/15 ICAs instead of 13/15 but pass enough homeworks, the plots, and the final project, you'll get an A-). At the beginning of the semester, you get 2 tokens that allow you to redo assignments. Redoing a homework or ICA costs 1 token while redoing a plot project or the final project costs 2 tokens. You can earn up to 2 more tokens by doing additional assignments. I didn't do any of the bonus assignments and used 1 token and ended the semester with an A. This is probably one of the easiest and most enjoyable classes for the stat major/minor. #tCFS25"

Thankfully, most of them don't take awfully long to complete, but it's nice to be able to get it done early.\nMake sure to start the project early, because it will kick your butt if you wait till the last minute. You are allowed to use ChatGPT or any generative AI tool to help you with the project, so make use of that! Otherwise, the class is fairly chill and the professor is pretty helpful."

He spends the 3rd day doing in-class assignments, which are fine within themselves, but class can feel dragged out in some aspects for this extra class within the week. That said, Prof Ross assigns homework in ways that demand a level of excellence to pass his specifications grading. At the end, you become a fantastic data visualizer. That said, you will be stressed in parts of the semester trying to get enough \"S\" marks for a satisfactory grade as you only have so many make-up tokens and homeworks are spaced out enough that you don't always know where your grade stands. Make sure you do everything early so you're not at the mercy of his busy schedule (as everyone else is) when figuring out questions to pulse check if you might want to revise your work. Also, do your final project as early as you can for the same reasons. Then you'll be cruising for the class.\nKeep in mind that Prof Ross is harsh on the students so that they do well. When it really counts (i.e., grading the final project), he's a fair man. However, he might not feel that way throughout the course and grading ICA's (Friday In-class Assignments) or other homeworks. This is simply how he is as a professor in an effort to push students to do well and not bs the class. For that reason, some students don't like him. At the end of the day, I've grown to appreciate professors like him as he's one of the litmus tests for good and lazy students.

            "text": "Syllabus: This course is specifications grading based. To get an A, you need a satisfactory score on 13/15 ICAs (In-class Activities), 9/10 HWs, 2/2 on the Plot Contests, and a 2/2 on the Final Project.\nOverview: This class is really an odd one because I think the content is probably some of the most useful that I have learned at UVA, but I also strongly dislike the grading system that is used by Ross. It is a very useful class because you get to create numerous data visualizations and learn how to clean data in order to create these graphics. Your candidacy will be bolstered for any job that requires the use of R or the creation of graphics using data. However, for the grading, I found the specifications system to be very frustrating due to the fact that instructions could be confusing which may prevent you from earning a point. You are given two tokens that can be used to resubmit assignments. You can use one to resubmit a HW or ICA, or two to resubmit the project (or submit it late). There are two bonus opportunities to earn two more tokens.\nHWs can take a few hours to complete or 30-min. This is another thing that annoyed me because there is a ton of variability in assignment length. This is the same thing with ICAs, which are basically HW assignments that you complete with a group in class. ICAs need to be completed in the class period and submitted at the end of class. Some take a lot of time and can be quite stressful due to the time constraints.\nThe plot contests are not extremely difficult and it is very feasible to score a 1 on both. One involves creating the worst plot possible for a dataset and the other involves using your project data to make a set of strong visualizations.\nFor the project, START EARLIER THAN YOU THINK. I left the work for my project until the final two weeks of the semester, and I still felt crammed for time. The project allows you to make a really cool story from your dataset, but it requires a strong attention to detail and a good bit of coding to create the visualizations needed. Additionally, you need to write multiple pages of description and explanation that goes over the choices you made in the project and the story of your data.\nTo summarize, I think you should take this course, but prepare for some frustration if you take it with Ross. Him and some other professors in the department seem to be really gung-ho on this specifications grading system. I find it to be a huge pain to deal with, but I ended up finishing with an A, so it definitely is achievable to do well in the course."

The class itself has 4 homework total that account for 100% of your grade. It may sound easy, but it is not. The instructions are very vague and need quite a bit of clarifications, which he won't tell you unless you ask him explicitly. There are no means of effectively communicate with him; he is not very approachable outside of class. Continuing with the homework, the grading is very harsh. 90% is an A in the class, but you'll get a point off, which is 1% of your grade, if you put too many words in your submission, even when the question asks to analyze the output. If you account for that and put fewer amount of words, then he will take a point off for not explaining in detail. The professor for this class expects you to do graduate level of work and makes the homework to be at that level.  If you want to learn about databases, do not take this class, This class will learn about data visualization for 75% of the class, from HW 1 to HW 3, and touch on DB after that.

I was on pace to get a high A (A+ range) but decided to take CR/NC in all of my classes (Covid 19) and thus had no incentive to do the last homework (or watch any lecture videos for the last two months of the course, lol). As some other reviews have touched on, the lecture style is ridiculous. Showing off thousands of lines of code isn't the way to teach programming. What's important is learning the fundamentals and way of thinking about problems because you can always google for code samples and refer to stackoverflow + documentation when you're actually programming. Instead of teaching how to think about data visualization problems, the professor just showed us how to do a bunch of them in R, which is useless because, once again, you can always refer to online documentation to do this. I can't comment on his effectiveness for the database portion because I didn't watch any of the lectures or do the homework - I had a  gut feeling that it would be bad and that I'd be better off taking the databases course in the CS department."

The problems in the assignments would vary in difficulty, with some taking literally 2 seconds, while others cost my group entire weekends. He intentionally provided open-ended questions, and I agree with his reasoning for it, but what I didn't agree with was him not providing clear enough instructions on what he was expecting for full credit, so we were taking shots in the dark for a not insignificant portion of our semester grade. In addition, we simply received our grade for the entire assignment, and had to go the extra distance to figure out why we missed the points we did.\nThis class wasn't hard, however, if you know R (like if you've taken STAT 3080 or STAT 1601).

Justin says he doesn't know who will teach STAT 3480 after he leaves or if the class will even be offered again soon.  I would highly recommend taking this class  with Justin while you have the chance!  He is an energetic and caring instructor who will go out of his way to help you when you ask.  The class material is interesting, and Justin's examples can be pretty entertaining (especially during basketball season).  There are small weekly homework assignments, three exams (not cumulative), and a final project.  The workload is very manageable , and it is easy to get a good grade if you put the effort in."

Justin is an absolutely amazing instructor, and if he ever taught another class I would take it in a heartbeat. He is so organized, and lecture slides for the next class are usually posted soon after the previous class. His homework turn around time is sometimes same day, and grades exams in less than a week. The class consists of weekly homework, which is never more than 3 problems (took me max 2 hours/week), three exams, and a partner project. All of these assignments were extremely manageable, and he gives a ton of guidance on the project. Additionally, you get a letter size sheet front and back for every exam, which is more than enough to write everything from the lectures down. The class can get a little boring with hypothesis test after hypothesis test, but Justin does his best to have interesting examples, and understands when things get a little dull. This class might be a little more difficult if you have no experience with R, but Justin posts example code from everything we do in class and it is well commented. Overall, I could not recommend this class more!!"

Primarily, this is a pretty easy course. The grade breakdown is as follows: 20% weekly quizzes, 20% midterm 1, 20% midterm 2, 20% final, 20% group project. The weekly quizzes are 5 MC questions and are literally so easy-- they took me 3 mins to complete and I got 100s on all of them, they come straight from lecture slides. Midterms and finals are also pretty simple-- just review your notes. He gives optional HW that he doesn't collect or grade, but he also releases the solutions. I never did them, but would look over the answers before exams to get a gist of what to expect/ how to write notation which was super helpful. The group project also isn't a lot of work. R is utilized in this class almost every lecture to supplement material, but you never have to code for exams; it's just nice to see how to apply the tests we learned in class to actual data sets. Also, I found this class super unique and useful. Basically, this is the course that teaches you how to perform statistical tests when you can't assume certain parametric assumptions regarding your sample data. Every lecture is basically a new type of non-parametric test and just goes through how to perform/ carry out the test/ when you would use them. There really aren't any proofs in this class; sometimes he'll show a \"mini proof\" on how some test statistics / distributions are related, but they're mostly trivial. Overall, this is a great class taught by a great professor that isn't hard to do well in. Can't really ask for much more. Plus, Justin is a cool guy and likes to talk about basketball a lot (he's particularly young) so he's extremely chill.\n#tCF2020"

The lectures are never too dry but never too complicated also so you can really do well in this course even if you are not a math and statistics wizard. I would definitely recommend, you will not have to spend grueling hours studying. 3 tests that were not bad at all- just know the lectures pretty cold. And the project was very straightfoward as well. I would say the weekly quizzes were easy. and the homeworks definitely help in time for the exam."

The course itself I think might describe that prior knowledge of R isn't required - I survived the class without knowing a single thing about R, but I was also a CS major going in. There are (well-documented) labs throughout the semester you need to complete using R, but I managed it. If you think you might have trouble picking up R as you go, take SAS and R  or some other class where you learn R first before this class and you'll have a better time with it.Final exam was this big stats project which is doable if you've been following along all semester. If you're having trouble with R or the class, ask after class because it is really hard to schedule time with Mr. Diver otherwise since he's like 4 hours away. So don't expect to have final-exam-office-hours type stuff because you need to have your questions ready for when he gives in-class work time."

You learn different aspects of business analytics in R and Excel throughout the semester, and you work on a semester-long project with a partner non-profit based in Charlottesville-- which is really cool! Except, it can be very hard to get the data you may need answer your particular business question which in turn takes a toll on the quality of the project you are able to submit at the end. The entire class is also specifications grading which can be really hard to keep track of throughout the semester in regards to where your grade is at. Only other gripe is that it's one of those reverse classes, where you watch a video lecture at home, and do classwork problems during class time without and class time lectures. This is a general pain point for the statistics department and I think I speak for a lot of students when I say this isn't the most ideal method of learning-- it's hard to stay engaged in both settings (the video lecture, and the self-paced classwork activities). Overall, the class could have been a lot better if it's format and logistics were improved. #tCFS24"

Prof Martinet teaches you how to use excel (e.g., pivot tables, excel functions, and more that you will use everyday at work) and how to logically think about the best ways to optimize modeling in R within classification and logistical regression contexts. My only complaint is that the requirements for meeting specifications on assignments can feel very arbitrary and annoying at times. At the end of the day, I felt that it mimicked what you might encounter after college in accomplishing the work that's directly asked of you rather than what you think makes sense. That, however, being part of a college experience makes sense but ultimately is a bit cumbersome.\nLooking at the class with a birds eye view, it's more or less a capstone class with assignments slotted in. I think the assignments are good, but the capstone aspect (i.e., working with the nonprofit) can be some work. For me personally, I got a lot of good experience about the specific non profit we worked with, so it was solid. However, knowing that it changes semester by semester, mileage can vary.

For the love of everything, please take STAT 3220 before this class. I think it’s a prerequisite now but it didn’t used to be and my group member who had only taken STAT 2120 was completely lost on some of the more stat heavy units. I’m shocked they didn’t make it a prereq to begin with. Just in general, Maria is very nice and her heart is in the right place but many people did not feel as though she was an effective professor.

But, I would seriously only take this class if you are very VERY comfortable with coding because there was definitely no coding help at all during lecture and the first assignment was very difficult, so I dropped the class because they only got progressively harder as the semester went on.

He also prefers to teach advanced statistical concepts in a purely theoretical framework, so I feel like I can apply very little to real life, and I LOVE sports analytics. He IS very nice, as a small saving grace.\nIn terms of grading, there's literally 4 assignments this semester (3 smaller ones, and one bigger project). They're all group work, so find a good group who knows how to code, as that's what you'll be doing for 90% of the questions. They're pretty time-consuming, but since they don't happen that often, this class was an off-on class, where I forgot I was enrolled in it when we didn't have assignments, and when we did, I spent time on it. Also, he doesn't release grades until literally the end of the semester. He made it sound like it's an easy A if you show dedication though.\nDo I recommend this class? Kinda? It's good if you have a busy semester, but it's a pretty dull class overall.\n#tCFfall2021"

            "text": "Overall, this was a very interesting course that was not too difficult to perform well in.\nLectures: Overall, the lectures tend to be very heavy theory wise with complicated derivations done by Professor Yu during most of the lecture, followed by some applications in R towards the end of each lecture. However, the theory certainly comes in handy during the homework at times when code examples have not been provided, so I would try to grasp the foundations of many of the algorithms which will be presented to you over the course of the semester.\nGrading: 30% HW (3 of them), 30% Midterm, 40% Final Project\nHomeworks: While there are only 3 homeworks over the course of the semester, they do take a bit of time to do well on-- I would say each one took me on average 10-12 hours to complete. Fair warning: the first homework was graded much more harshly than the latter two, so if you do poorly on the first homework assignment, don't feel as though the rest of the course will be impossible. Overall though, the code that Professor Yu uses during lecture and makes available on Collab are very useful for the homework problems. I would certainly reccomend finding a group early on which you can work on homeworks with, and attending Professor Yu's office hours if you have any questions.\nMidterm: The midterm was pretty straight forward and is very similar in content and difficulty to the practice midterm which Professor Yu releases. I was extremely nervous going into the exam as I had performed poorly on HW1 (which was our only other grade in at the time) and ended up getting an A on the exam.\nProject: The project is composed of 3 parts: data processing report (10% of grade), presentation to class (10% of grade), and final report (20% of grade). The project was a Kaggle competition which was scored based on your group's ability to minimise RMSE from a training data set provided onto a test set. Both the data processing report and presentation were graded very easily (in essence completion). The final report took a bit of time (really just trying to construct an adequate model), but wasn't too bad especially if you have a good group.\nOverall, Professor Yu was very accommodating and willing to meet with you during office hours or at other times to go over homework questions or any other concerns you may have with the course. When there weren't any assignments due, there really wasn't much to do in the class, but keep in mind that homeworks really do take a while to work on so make sure to begin them well ahead of the due dates if you want to do well on them.\n#tCFspring2021"

Literally one of the nicest professors I've had in the stats department: I literally don't know anyone who took the course who didn't like him.\nBreakdown: 30% HW; 30% Midterm; 40% final project (so fairly standard grade breakdown for a stats class).\nLecture: Lectures were usually highly theoretical. The content is pretty interesting and intersects well with other graduate stats classes (especially 6190). Overall, I don't necessarily know if attending class was super necessary. I kinda stopped going towards the end of the semester (after the first midterm). HW can generally be done without going to class, but the midterm is based heavily off of lecture material so I would at least try to attend frequently for the first half of the course.\nMidterm: Super easy if you paid attention during class. You get a cheat sheet front and back you can make and bring to the exam which was definitely helpful. The hardest part was honestly the T/F at the beginning which was mostly questions he talked about during lecture not on the slides which is why I recommend attending lecture for the first half of the course at a minimum.\nHWs: He said there would be 5-6 HW but we barely had enough time to get 4 in lol. They're all pretty straight forward. The first two take MUCH longer than the latter two in my experience as the first ones are way more proof based than the other two which rely much more on computation in R. The slides will be your best friend for these homeworks so make sure to use them if you get stuck.\nFinal Project: 5% 1 page draft of project outline (basically completion); 15% presentation; 20% final written report. Pretty standard project. He just asks you to find a dataset and analyze it using the methods we learned during the course. The written report is supposed to be 10-15 pages single spaced which at first seemed daunting but wasn't really that bad (plus me and my partner literally basically wrote the entire report in one sitting and did fine on the project).\nOverall, this is a great stats elective to take. Great professor, interesting content, and not hard to do well in.\n#tCFfall2021"

            "text": "This class wasn't that great overall. Prof. Tang is a nice guy, but he didn't plan the class very well and he felt like he was unable to adapt to the needs of his class.\nWe only had one short homework assignment before the midterm, which left most of the class feeling unprepared for the difficulty of the exam. When we asked him to give us more practice assignments, he agreed that we did not have enough practice assignments and then gave us 2 short assignments between the midterm and the final. The homework was graded on completion and our lowest score was dropped, so effectively we only had 2 required assignments throughout the semester. It is a little strange to basically beg your professor to give us more work so that we can engage with the material and prepare for the exams, but that is basically how this semester felt. Lectures were fairly dry, and since there were so few assignments, there was not much of an incentive to pay attention even if I wanted to, which I couldn't.\nAnother strange moment of the semester was when Prof. Tang told us halfway through the semester that he had been contacting the wrong TA. I'm not sure how it took him 7 weeks to realize that the TA that he had been contacting was not assigned to his class, but it did.\nThe content in this class was actually pretty interesting. He just needs to take the time to design this class better. Give more assignments and give students a way to engage with and practice the material. I think this class has great potential, but as it is I can't say that I would recommend the class."

            "text": "Denny is a terrible instructor who has no idea how to lecture, grade, or write a test. His lecture slides consist of incomprehensible, poorly-scaled screenshots of equations. He wastes multiple lectures talking about absolute nothingness, like how good it is to study statistics. He makes you do advanced statistics on a graphing calculator for tests, which are ridiculously difficult, but he doesn't realize this because he deludes himself by giving extremely generous grades. The final project barely related to the course content. He is unable to keep himself organized, and only assigned three homework assignments the whole semester despite promising one approximately every other week. He at least acts like a nice instructor who is willing to help, but he won't help you due to his deep incompetence. You will learn nothing in a class with Denny, but at least it's not too hard to get an adequate grade by taking advantage of how little he cares."

Overall, it’s a very manageable and is the definition of an easy A, though you should expect to spend around 3 hours per week on homework.\nThe class moves at a fairly slow pace, and most of the concepts are straightforward - especially if you’re comfortable with basic math. Kristina genuinely cares about her students' success and did an excellent job preparing us for the midterms and final exam.\nThere are weekly quizzes every Friday, so regular attendance is important. However, the quizzes are quite easy and often include bonus riddles that can help boost your score.\nI’d recommend this class if you have a solid grasp of foundational math. Some of my peers struggled a bit, especially those who didn’t feel as confident in math, but I personally found it very easy. It’s a great option if you’re looking to fulfill a math requirement or raise your GPA with a low-stress course."

Exams are very reasonable but you have to put in the work, and when they say she's a fair grader it's true, but not in a forgiving sense. Overall I thought this was a good class, but if you want an A, you're going to have to put in the work."

There were hws every other week and quizzes on the opposite weeks. Neither were very difficult or time consuming. He uses the book, but it's mostly for the hw problems. I'd recommend going to class but if you miss he teaches more or less out the book so it's fine to make up but his lectures are definitely better than learning from the book. I found the exams to be pretty easy as you are provided with the equations, so as long as you know what's going on its a bit of plug and play. I didn't feel like I learned that much about financial stuff as it was more math and less concepts (more or less), but nonetheless a great course."

Exams were easy if you did the homework and did some studying, but hours on end is not necessary. As a psyc major, I found this class to be pretty easy and highly enjoyable. Everything we learned was relevant to our lives and i feel like this is one of the first classes i've ever taken that has prepared me for life after school.

This class is definitely one of the easiest math classes you can take at UVA, and one of the most applicable too. Although the curriculum varies by semester, the class covered lots of basic financial topics that are very applicable in daily life - interest, annuities, mortgages, retirement planning, credit cards, etc. Unlike most of the math classes I had taken in high school, I actually felt like I was getting something out of this class that I could use and apply in the future - not just learning math for the sake of completing credits. Calculators were needed for all aspects of the class, which was welcoming given calculator rules in other math classes at UVA.Assignments consisted of biweekly homework assignments and quizzes (alternating weeks), neither of which were too challenging. Group work was encouraged for the homework assignments and quiz studying. The two midterm exams were not cumulative, but did include a bit of information from previous concepts learned in the class (lots of the material builds on concepts from earlier in the class). The final exam was cumulative and a formula sheet was allowed. #tCFspring2022"

I will say, he is SUPER smart and obviously passionate about mathematics, so when I took the course he sometimes struggled to dumb it down enough for us non-STEM/ non-math folks. It's also just generally a pretty boring topic, so it is not at all an exciting class and can be hard to sit through lectures sometimes. But, he definitely knows what he's talking about and is willing to help you if you ask him for extra help. Generally, I would recommend you form a little study group with 1-2 other people in the class and work through old quizzes and homework/classwork before quizzes and tests if you can. Questions you've already seen/ solved will DEFINITELY show up again, and it sucks when you know you've seen it before but just can't remember how to solve it. So look over previous quizzes and assignments! When I took it (pre-covid) there were weekly quizzes, but they were usually pretty short and not too bad. He also dropped the lowest 2 quiz grades, which was a huge help. We had a few homework assignments but most of the work was done in-class when he gave examples, so take good in-depth notes to look over and you should be fine! There is a midterm exam and a final exam."

Much of what you will learn is completely applicable to typical questions you encounter every day regarding your personal finances.  Among the topics we touched on included annuities, interest, mortgages, and stocks.  The course itself is pretty straightforward and manageable if you put about two hours in every week to understand the material, and Mark offers a plethora of office hours if you have any questions about it.  If you have even a passing interest in finance, I highly recommend you enroll in this class.  If not, the skills you will learn will still be very useful down the road."

Some people did struggle a bit, but I am not a math person at ALL and was able to easily finish with an A. I would highly, highly, recommend paying a lot of attention during lecture and writing down all examples, as well as doing all of the homework and reviewing the homework in-depth before quizzes or exams, because a lot of the same stuff shows up. She definitely gives you the material to get A's on every quiz and exam, as long as you actually do the assigned homework and ask questions if you don't understand. Sometimes class can drag on and on because she focuses on easy concepts for too long, but even this didn't bother me too much since it just shows that she really wants to be sure that everyone understands the concepts. She did assign a bit too much homework when Covid first hit and we had to abruptly go online, but I think this was just her confusion with the online format and hopefully by now she has figured out how to make the homework more manageable. BUT, some concepts are challenging and won't be the easiest thing to grasp. She always offers office hours though, and as I said, doing the homework and actually studying it before any exam/quiz is the best way to do well in this class."

Grade is 30% tests, so each of the 3 tests is 10% of your grade. Then another 10% is participation, which is just showing up to class. Another 10% is the homework, which is completion. Then another 10% is weekly quizzes, which are 5-6 questions, very easy. Then 20% is 2 projects and the last 20% is the final, which you can exempt. I did 1 hour of work MAX each week for this class and was able to get an A in the class. The topics for the course were - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and various visual representations of base ten units, positive and negative numbers, and topics similar to these. Professor Choi is so understanding and nice and base the 8 am lectures better. SHe responds to emails so quick and is very kind with stepping through material in class when someone has a question. I loved this class so much that I am taking another one of her math classes next semester!"

This class is dedicated to students who are wishing to go into the teaching field; specifically, it is oriented towards potential elementary school teachers. The classes are extremely boring but required because not attending entails a 2% deduction on your grade. Moreover, he gives a lot of homework that comes off as busywork as it is never graded for correctness but rather completion. The exams are really easy but he is super picky about things like diagrams, pictures, and explanations. Overall, it is a GPA-padding class but it is super boring; be sure to get work for other classes done while you're in this one. As much as I love Zack, I think that this class and its material is too dry. As a prospective teacher, I do not think I learned anything meaningful for real-world applications. All the subject matter is stuff that a good algebra student should intuitively know."

It was frustrating, because I actually wanted to gain something from the course since I plan on teaching elementary school students. I think Thomasey should have used the textbook a lot more than he did. The textbook does a great job of combining easy content with more challenging modes of understanding that content. If you are taking the class for an easy A/math credit, I would say don't get the textbook at all. If you want to teach elementary school, I would absolutely recommend the textbook.

Since growth based is graded more harshly than standard grading it is very difficult to get a high score under that syllabus. However, if you work hard and ask questions in growth based you can succeed. I would encourage you to look at the feedback you get on each exam and the rubric for what they are looking for in order to do well. I did this towards the end and it helped me a lot. I ended with a B after having an F the whole time so I'm glad I pushed through. You can do it if you study and ask questions!"

She made the class enjoyable, was funny, and would walk through all the steps needed to make sure that we understood what we were learning. She also wrote the 1190/1210 quizzes and exams so she would explain what to expect. Because she wrote the exams, Prof. Kurtz would take student feedback into consideration when writing the next assessment. Prof. Kurtz was always super prepared and cared about you as a person. She is very down to earth and made it clear that perfection is not expected and that no matter what the outcome of your performance in Calc is, you will accomplish what you want in life. The class was very laid back and after going over the first problem, we were often then told to work and teach people around us. I wasn't a fan in the beginning, but as the semester progressed, I liked it more. It was also a great way for the class to bond. Assignments consisted of classpreps (due before each class), Webassigns (every week (access through the textbook)), Friday attendance (the only main difference between 1210), and quizzes and exams. I was in the Standard section so quizzes made up 5% of your grade but each exam was worth 20% and the final was worth 25% (1190 has the same quizzes and exams as 1210 and is not given \"easier\" exams). MATH 1190/1210 Growth-Based had a different grading system based on the mastery of each learning target. Though I don't know for sure, I was told that Growth-Based has slightly harsher grading and not as much partial credit because they get retakes whereas Standard gets one try but much more partial credit. I found partial credit to be a huge lifesaver. They made it completely possible for you to get full credit on some questions even if you got the wrong answer. One of their main goals is to asses whether or not you understand the process you are supposed to complete rather than focusing on getting the correct answer (on assessments, write down the steps you would take and any important info from the question, even if you don't know which numbers or expressions to use :).\nIf you aren't sure if you should take 1190 or 1210 I would say that if you have any background in calc and have done decently, take 1210 and leave room in the class for those who have not had experience in calc. The only difference between 1190 and 1210 is that 1190 meets for a longer time and has a Friday session. All 1190/1210 student share the same Canvas page and are expected to complete the same assignments. 1190/1210 quizzes and exams are the exact same and you will test together. Quizzes and exams are all graded the same (they aren't even looking at who they are grading when they are grading and each professor takes a question or two and only grades those questions for all 1190/1210 students- so don't worry about being graded differently based on what section you are in). #tCFS24"

She has a straightforward and streamlined way of explaining problems, which makes the material easier to understand. She taught 1210 and 1220 before, and she is certainly an effective professor for both of them. I barely had to put any work outside just lecture time, since lectures were enough to understand what I needed to do. I was in the growth-based section, so I did get re-takes, but there was not as much partial credit. However, I prefer the standard-section grading and would not do growth-based again if I had the option. This class doesn't have any trigonometry in it (which I consider to be difficult), and the problems are mostly basic. MATH 1190 is for those who are entering without any experience or want to have an algebra review."

Also these grad students are genuinely incompetent. My instructor said in class \"sometimes I get 2+2 wrong\" like bro what do you mean. I am about to get a c in this class because I make a single mistake on a problem and then the entire page is worth 0 even if you get eveyrthing else correct.

The teacher didn’t always explain things clearly, and the assignments were really long and confusing. Sometimes it felt like we were expected to know things that weren’t even taught. There wasn’t much help when we had questions, and the tests were really tough. I spent so many hours trying to figure things out on my own. Overall, I highly would not recommend this class unless you absolutely have to take it. It was stressful and frustrating, and there are probably better options out there that actually help you learn instead of just making you feel lost."

He had a rule for group work where every single time all semester we did it, we had to pick someone we had never worked with before. Towards the end of the year it took ridiculously long to find someone to work with, time that could've been spent working problems. He also said \"minus\" instead of negative, which are two completely separate things and caused confusion. Weekly webassigns, some random written homework, 2 midterms, and a final. The first midterm wasn't curved, the second was, and I think there's a curve at the end of the class as well."

It may be the same for every applied calc class though. If you do take this class, I would suggest in finding a partner to help each other on the online work; you would finish it faster and learn better. I would recommend Prof. Sherman because he's more experienced. I took two classes with a graduate before switching to Prof. Sherman's class, and I could obviously see the difference between the two."

Taking math in the summer is the best way in my opinion because it is consistent and is a fast pace which is how I thrive. I also took AB and BC calc in high school so I found this class to be more review than anything. The content is EASY. The hardest part of this class is appealing to what Prof. Sherman wants when you turn in daily homework/exams. He wants people to write out all of their math in English sentences and only turn that in on some problems (requests NO other work shown). This was very frustrating for me because my past calc teacher would always tell us to just write out our work because he could follow along. This was very annoying because I was always chasing a good grade based on his own expectations that had nothing to do with the difficulty of the content. If you need to take it in the summer, just do it because I still ended with an A, and had fun being in a smaller class (getting to know other people). Just be prepared to be annoyed for 4 weeks until it is over."

I took this class during the summer, so the material was much faster paced than it would have been in fall or spring semester, but overall, professor Kurtz made the material pretty understandable. She has a great and fun personality as well, so she made the class much more enjoyable than any other math professor would have. If you want a good grade in calculus, do yourself a favor and take it with professor Kurtz!"

It also feels tedious to do the homework (which is the best form of practice). Yaolong is an average-good teacher, he's open to questions and his work is easy to follow.

He starts class usually by introducing a theory or process we'll need that day, then goes through several examples. However, the classwork that is supposed to correspond to his lesson is often barely applicable. There is a huge disconnect between what he teaches and what is actually needed to be successful in the course. If you take this class, I highly recommend attending regular P2L sessions, watching Organic Chemistry Tutor on Youtube, and luck sometimes. I am not a math person, and this class really affirmed it. Even in the assessments we had to take (3 quizzes and 2 exams, plus the final), the questions were much more applied than the basic homework questions we were given. Be prepared to put in a lot of extra time for this class if calculus doesn't come naturally to you, or try to take the pilot course, which seems much more focused on learning and growth."

If you have to take this for a prereq or something else, try to get him as your teacher. I took 1210 because there's no discussion section, but there are multiple P2L (peer tutoring) optional sections you can attend every week taught by students who have taken the course before if you need more practice or have random questions. You can also go to his office hours if you want some better-informed help/advice. Grades are based off \"minute\" papers which are just quick one-question sheets you fill out at the beginning of all classes, WebAssign/Gradescope assignments, and like 5ish assessments. It seems like a lot but is very doable and the assignments are quick. You do have to pay like $100+ just to access the webassigns though which is really annoying imo because there's no way around it (you can't just find a pdf of textbook). I took calc in high school but never took the AP test so did not get credit, and I've gotten 100% on every test so far this year. I think it might be a bit difficult if you have absolutely no experience or background with calculus, but the style of the class is very similar to one in high school (no laptops, worksheets handed out every class, and you follow along with teacher/work with classmates) so it's chill."

It consisted of a few online homework assignments 1-3 times a week, along with a longer weekly assignment we were required to work on throughout the week. The homework assignments are graded, but you are given instant feedback and are able to fix your answers until you get it right, a feature that I enjoyed. There aren't many quizzes maybe 2-3 throughout the whole semester. Also, there are only 2 midterms and 1 final exam. The midterms were very doable. If you took calculus in high school, you will be fine. But if you didn't it may be hard, because she kind of just reteaches the material to us, rather than teaching. But, it isn't impossible and the textbook would be your friend if so."

Then, there is no time left to tackle the difficult problems where everyone in the class needs help. The class design sucks, and you barely learn anything in-class.A big problem with the course is the lack of correlation between the HW assignments and the exams. Every exam is a bit of a shock if you don't spend a significant amount of time prepping on your on. My high school Calc experience kind of saved me since I already felt good on most of it.The grading was very frustrating. All semester I got large amounts of partial credit taken off and it accumulated quickly because my work was deemed \"unclear\" or I didn't explain it using words. I hardly ever knew why I got points off constantly because there is no explanation and I copied my professors notation from class."

            "text": "I took this class in Fall of 2023 and I had a lot of friends in the class which helped me enjoy it more. Kristina is a very sweet and wholesome person. She is very understanding about your problems and is always willing to help outside of class. She does check attendance with PollEverywhere and assigns the same homework and worksheets as all of the other Calc 1 teachers. I don't think her teaching is the best and I did fine because I knew most of the information before I took this class, but she is willing to help if you have questions and office hours are super easy to attend. I was in the Growth-Based Section of Calc 1, which I was not a fan of. In growth-based, each learning target on the test (so each question) is graded out of 4. You essentially need to get as many 4/4s as you can get. You have the opportunity to retake each learning target 2 more times to get 4/4. The only issue is that the retakes start to add up and you can end up spending 2+ hours on these tests (there are 6 including the final), working on material from months ago. Its a lot of work and its more beneficial to get 4/4 on some questions and get 0/4 on the others than to get all questions with a 3/4 because you have to redo them all if you don't master it (if this makes sense). The non-growth-based sections simply take the class as normal and the tests are a simple percentage out of 100, without any retakes. You have no choice of which section you will be in, its all random. The material isn't hard and there is a lot of study help, but understanding the way the course works can be super confusing. In the end it probably doesn't matter if you want to take this course because it is required for a lot of majors but take Kristina. A lot of the professors are the same teaching style, at least she is nice and you'll mostly know what she is talking about. She pushes you to talk to people around you and I made a lot of friends this way."

He would try to make jokes to lessen the awkward silence in class. He taught as if everyone in the class already took calc. There were a couple of students who were in the same boat that I was. I tried going to office hours but when I asked a question I felt as if he was giving me \"DUH\" answers as if I took calc before. It didn't matter how many times I would explain to him that I did not calc before, he would still answer my questions with more math terms that I didn't understand. I know that he is very knowledgeable about the material but he is just not a very good teacher.  For assignments, we had to do about 2 or 3 webassigns before quizzes and tests.

This is supposedly the easier of the calc I courses at UVA but the way it is taught is so gosh darn frustrating. Classes are taught by grad students, who know the material, but sometimes struggle with conveying it to students. My advice if you have to take this class is to find a group of people in your section to check homework with and go to office hours. P2L sessions kind of helped but more often than not we only got through like 2-3 problems. It was a lot of definitions of math rather than equation and applications, which isn't bad itself but I really just wanted the equations and do my work without writing proofs for everything. They like to see work done in a specific, methodological manner and it shows when they grade your work. Good luck."

However, he is simply a grad student like all the rest of the \"professors\" with no experience teaching. This makes it EXTREMELY difficult to learn anything in class, so much to the point where I just stopped attending because it actually made me more confused.\nWebassign homework is nice because you can try until you get 100. That's the only good thing about the class. Seriously this class was the bane of my existence and my friends'. The quizzes were pretty horrid - we all got 60s on the first one. They do curve though, so a 78 became an A-. The exams- DO NOT GET ME STARTED. They are unreal and unfair. The curve is literally 55 becomes a C because they are so bad. And it's so frustrating because we get worksheets on the topic we are learning every class, yet we would start them at 10 am, have to do them alone in our group before learning the content, and then Howard would start checking the worksheet literally at 10:48 am when the class ends at 10:50. it is seriously so unorganized and caused me distress.

In this way, the basis of this course was hands-on learning. Short online assignments due before each class were very helpful in warming me up to the material before we learned about it. It forced me to practice what I had learned frequently, which promotes learning. In the same way, longer homework assignments due weekly were helpful opportunities to synthesize all that we had learned throughout the week and work through problems we might see on the exam. A few quizzes were given periodically throughout the semester to gauge our understanding. In addition, we had two midterms and a final. Exams were on paper, were a fair difficulty, and well put-together. Overall, the structure of this course was done very well. Our grade was calculated in the following manner:\nWebAssign homework (short assignments and longer ones): 10%Quizzes: 5%Written HW (uploaded online a few times throughout the year): 5%Classwork: 5%Midterm Exam 1: 22.5%Midterm Exam 2: 22.5%Final Examination: 30%\nI enjoyed this course.

Her office hours were during one of my other classes, so I often could not go, but she was always willing to meet outside of the class at other times! The class is pretty easy to do well in, so long as you do the homework and the Collab Discussion (that adds up to 25% of your grade right there), and do ALL of the practice tests because those will test your knowledge before the test (similar questions from the practice test are often on the real test). Good Luck! :)"

Anything the Calc coordinators give you, make sure you take advantage of it.

Anyone who is required to take MATH 1210, I suggest that you do not take it with Ian. Ian is very knowledgeable about the material; however, he lacks interpersonal skills. He does not engage with his students. Also, he comes into class very dull. On the other hand, I had to watch youtube videos to really understand the material that was taught or go to a math tutor in Gilmer Hall because the way he teaches the material was confusing to me. Sometimes, he does not even write how he got certain steps on the board, which I felt was not helpful at all. I guess he expected us to know it. For his quizzes, it was difficult to know what material I should really study for because he does not specify. He would merely say \"you will be quizzed on the material that I covered last week and this week.\" It turns out that is false because there are only specific sections that he covers on the quiz. By the way, his quizzes are usually only four questions. Another thing I would like to point out is how he rarely responds back to his emails, which my classmates have told me this whenever they had a question on the material taught. I highly suggest that you take this class with a different professor."

I feel like this class is pretty unavoidable if you want to do anything pre-med or pre-comm or really just most majors so sorry that you're going to have to go through this misery. My piece of advice would be GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! You are assigned written homework every week that is about ten times harder than any of the webassign homework you are given and they are graded out of 100. If you go to office hours the teachers will practically just give you the answers and you'll get good grades. I made the mistake of not going to office hours for the first few weeks and my grade definitely suffered because of that. The webassign homework is alright. The tests on the other hand are also very difficult unless you go over the practice tests inside and out. The final was impossible honestly. I think I'll get a B for this semester and I did not have prior Calculus experience. Have fun :)"

There are times where he messed up during his teaching and students have to correct him.

From firsthand experience and testaments from friends who have other calculus teachers, Peter is the best.\nOverall, this course is super easy if you're familiar with calculus in any way.

Definitely recommend Joe out of all of the grad applied calc teachers."

I'll give a 3 for difficulty just because some people found it a bit trickier. Many people in the class had taken some form of calculus before, but our class usually had an average higher than the average of the 600 students who take applied calc 1. He really wants everyone to do well, as you can get a 110% on all the online webassign homework. He also drops your lowest homework and your lowest quiz. There are only a few quizzes, and homework counts more than quizzes, anyway, so it's easy to get all the homework points. He's always available for extra help. Also, tests usually had some difficult questions, so make sure you know how to do the easier topics so that you can guarantee points from that. Always do the practice tests, and to study don't focus on homework questions that required a calculator. Def recommend!"

He is very fast-paced and can be difficult to keep up with, but he ALWAYS gives the opportunity for questions and is ALWAYS available outside of class. Tips for success: Go to his office hours/extra review sessions, go to the math tutoring center at Gilmer because they help a lot, and do the Webassigns and worksheets, but don't spend too much time on them because they don't really translate well to the exams. The webassigns are too easy for the exams and the worksheets are too complicated and never show up on the exams. Use your notes (don't really need the textbook), QUIZZES, and the biggest one: PAST EXAMS. He always gives those out so be sure to do those, write down what kinds of questions show up on a separate sheet of paper, and just google practice problems of what you find. Overall, not too terrible of a class, just be sure to keep up with the class, NEVER skip, and do practice problems all the time. I never took calculus coming out of high school, started the year with a D, followed these tips, and ended with a B."

She then pauses to ask if there are any questions every few minutes, giving responses that either don't help to explain the ideas whatsoever, or responses to questions that were a direct result of the students being unable to read her awful handwriting or understand her incredibly poor command of the English Language.\nIn short, she is the worst teacher I have ever had, not just at UVa, but in my entire time as a student. Why anyone in their right mind would ever have allowed her to teach a class is beyond me, I can only assume there is no screening process for these positions, otherwise anyone with half a brain would realise within 10-15 seconds that she is incompetent in the extreme and completely impossible to understand."

He doesn't ever stop to see if anyone has any questions and actually would get irritated sometimes if someone dared to have a question, because why would you be so rude to interrupt his teaching? Homework took up so much time. Like the other reviewer mentioned, they were always overly tricky, and for no good reasons because though I did find the exams difficult, I found the homework even MORE so. I didn't do well in this class because it ate up all my time and I had to focus on my other classes as well. It is possible to do well in Applied Calc I with Stephen Hardy if you are good at math, enjoy math, or have other classes on your plate which are easy so you can devote all your waking hours to this.

Sure Hardy is a little impersonal and can sometimes over-complicate basic concepts, but you only need to show up to take notes. Online homework is easy, written homework is excessively challenging- though it definitely makes the tests seem easy. (If you get stuck on the written homework, you can just go to his office hours and he'll basically tell you the answers) The tests themselves are fair, though you can lose a lot of points on small errors. The class has a decent curve, so it is not that difficult to do reasonably well with minimal effort. From what I have heard of the other teachers for this course, Stephen Hardy is a solid choice."

He rushes through concepts on the board, mumbling, and his handwriting is barely legible. Also he grades extremely harshly, but that doesn't make much of a difference as your course grade takes that into account. That being said, the course itself is really quite easy. I recommend buying the physical book because it basically walks you through how to do the problems. I stopped going to class after about 3 weeks except to take quizzes. Going is pointless if you can just learn from the book. If you can't then get a tutor because Weaver isn't going to be much help there. For the 2 midterms I literally looked at the material for the first time the night before the test and got 20 pts above the average on both. Same thing for the final, but that was cumulative. The curve was a lot lower than I was expecting. Overall this is not a hard course if you pick up concepts quickly/can teach yourself. If you can't do either then pick a different TA. Also you can't use a calculator at all in the course which sucks."

I found the course load somewhat manageable, but the test reviews did not fully reflect the tests, so I felt unprepared when exams rolled around.

Daniel got decent reviews but we weren't prepared for our first test at all with a class average around 70 and a high score of 90.  The test questions were harder than most problems on the practice test or homework assignments, and he used a question that referred to something we barely glanced on for a minute in lecture.  So far I haven't been very appreciative of him or his teaching methods.  Also, webassign (the homework system) is evil and he only allows five tries per question, which can kill people because the site is picky about how you put your answers in, which wastes lots of tries.  You could have the answer right and be told you're wrong anyway.\nAlso, this class is a target for those who really don't like or want math, so there were a lot of embarrassingly stupid and annoying people in this class who preferred to talk about the parties they were going to than actually learning the material- after being given an example problem to try, and i quote, a *third year* girl near me whined, \"Why doesn't he just put it up on the board for us?  I don't like to thinkkkkkk...\"  I would consider her average for the class."

Survey of Calc 2 is definitely easier than regular calc 2, but is unnecessarily difficult because you are expected to teach yourself at home before each class. Classes are meant to reinforce the material you learn through assigned videos and the textbook. Home grades don't count for too much of your grade, which is good because it's hard to get help on them when you need, especially if office hours don't fit your schedule. Prep and written homework assignments are a firm deadline, but the other homework can be extended. WebAssigns are nothing like the tests, its just a way to practice skills. Put extra emphasis on the practice tests, written homework, and class examples on the worksheets. Feeling confident on the other homework don't mean you'll do well on an exam. STUDY BEFORE THE WEEK OF EXAMS because office hours fill up on those weeks and its hard to get help or learn anything you don't understand last minute."

What I didn't realize was that this course would go much further in depth and cover more topics than a high school calc course (should be obvious for UVA, but it took me too long to make that connection). Around the midpoint of the course, I started to see a significant decline in my grades, having not paid too much attention throughout. I did poorly on the second midterm, and really had to turn things around going into the final. Lectures in general were not helpful for me, as I thought Evangelos moved too fast. Going back to review lecture notes, doing the webassigns and trying to get 100%, and attending office hours with specific questions was what I found to be most helpful, which is unfortunate considering that obviously none of this was in-class work. I did very well on the final with very in-depth, extensive preparation, and ended up with a B in the class. I know there was a curve applied as well to everyone's final grades, although I'm not sure exactly how much that was. As for advice going in, I'd strongly recommend going to office hours and reviewing practice questions going into exams. Considering the fact that they always do a curve, it's really not too bad of class, but it can be stressful for sure."

I personally found Dimou easy to follow, and I thought he did a good job explaining the new topics. If you attend class regularly and pay attention, you should be able to understand the lessons. The majority of the grade was the exams, but each one had a large curve, and I felt as though a lot of the exam problems matched the in-class problems, practice exams, and homework. The written homeworks and Webassign homeworks were also a large chunk of the grade, so if you put in the time for both of those you can do well.

Calc 2 is a notoriously annoying GPA killer at UVA, however Professor Kurts makes it as bearable and interesting as is humanly possible and genuinely wants to see her students succeed. This is something that I was not expecting going into a class with MATH 1220's reputation, and I am incredibly glad that my expectations were subverted. With my class being online, anything I say regarding the workload and exam structure probably won't be applicable to most, but I should mention that she curves your class grade after the class is finished.

Ala is a really funny and genuinely nice guy. A lot of people go into his class and sleep, but if you make any effort in the class you should perform well and earn his respect. The two tests aren't that easy, but the curve is kinda weird and works out pretty well for the most part. For whatever reason the averages on tests were never great, but most of my friends and I seemed to do well.\nOne note. It is a good and bad thing. There will be a class every now and then that he just doesn't give a crap and tells stories and messes around. This can be fun and entertaining if you understand the material, but frustrating if you don't. Thus, to get the most out of his class I would suggest coming in with a solid math background; nothing crazy, but enough so you are not always struggling. SOLID CLASS"

He's the kind of person that would be great to chill and hangout with one on one, and he makes our class laugh hysterically but when I asked him questions he did not really answer them well, or he would go off on a tangent about something were not even talking about. If you end up with him due to scheduling conflicts, its not the end of the world. Just know you're going to have to do a lot of explaining and teaching to yourself. If you can, I recommend taking Brian Thomas, I had him for Applied Calc 1 and he is a little awkward one-on-one but his lectures are very organized, he gets to the point and answers any questions you may have.Also, like all lower level math classes here, the tests are in the evenings with all the sections in a huge lecture hall taking the exams. 2 midterms, 1 final and weekly homeworks. sometimes the homework can be very tedious, other times its pretty straightforward."

He is constantly late to class. Be prepared for 20 minutes of jokes and to go through 2-3 sections per class. If you don't grasp everything in class, which 80% of the time, you won't, I'd suggest going to office hours. He is helpful 1 on 1, but office hours are always cramped.

The only thing I would make sure to do if you don't have a strong calculus background is to go to his office hours, they're usually packed but he is really good about making sure that everyone gets their questions answered.  Also he does show up late a lot which some other people have mentioned, but  don't worry about that because he makes sure to fit all the topics into class time.

I got over 100% on all the midterms and assignments except the final (I got a 95 on that), and I had never touched Calc II concepts before. He's unbelieveably funny. He had his own catch phrases  that he would say in his soft voice like \"Yeah, we're not playing around anymore,\" when introducing a new topic and \"Oh...man.\" His laugh always got me too. Honestly just do the webassign well, take good notes in class and really use the textbook to reinforce the lecture and you'll do well in Ala's class. I'm seriously considering taking MATH 1060  just because he teaches it. What an absolute legend. 10/10 please take him if you want to bring some life into your classes next semester."

There aren't a lot of assignments each week except for webassigns which corresponded with the lectures. I took AP BC calc in high school and I thought the material in this class is pretty different. A bunch of topics is taught including integration, probability, partial derivatives, and series. If you are not a math-oriented person then I would say this class is challenging and take math 1190 instead if you have the choice. As a statistics major, I found this class to be engaging and challenging but nothing overly difficult. If you have the option, I recommend taking this class w Nick Collins. I thought he did a good job of explaining the material. However, he does make his quizzes a bit harder in order to better prepare you for the exams. This is a coordinated course so everyone takes the same exams and your GTA does not create them. It's a game of chance really. Sometimes the exams are hard but other times they are not OVERLY difficult. Definitely take the practice exams released before each of the exams, I found them to be very helpful. Also, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. I found office hours very helpful for clarifying confusing concepts."

Not sure why the Spring 2019 reviews describe the class as relatively easy, coming from a Fall 2021 student it is absolutely not.\nThe format of the class a flipped classroom with the following dynamic:-You have to teach yourself the material at home from the calc textbook and provided YouTube videos-Complete some questions on the topic before coming into class-Instruction in class (which is confusing and hard to follow)-Homework assignment on the topic-Quiz on Friday-Written homeworks that are week-long every couple of weeks\nThis all leads up to VERY difficult material on the exams. It escalates quite a bit from the homework questions. I would say that if you have to take this course, as I did, try to take it as your only challenging class of the semester so you can really focus on it. It is a time commitment to really drill the concepts in. The average on the first exam was a 74 but the standard deviation was almost 20%. This tells me that the divide is huge - you're either acing or failing."

My only complaint for this class has to be the quizzes because it's given at the end of a lecture. Sometimes the lecture run onto the quiz time. There are three exams with the third one being cumulative. Practice exams are provided. There are also 4 written homework that is collaborative. If you have to take a Survey to Calc 2 class, Jiajun is definitely the instructor to choose."

I entered this course after achieving a B- in calc 1 and knew I had to put a lot of work in if I wanted to get that magical C+ I needed as a prerequisite for the econ major. My professor was Matt Gagne who honestly is one of the nicest people let alone professors I have ever met. He goes through content very quickly but gives examples of every question you will find on the exams and goes through Webassign problems in class on the board basically giving you the answers. He will cover a whole section of the book in one lecture then give you about 2 weeks to complete the relevant webassign and will over that period go through the toughest webassign problems.Do well on your webassign! It counts for 10% of your grade so it’s important if you need that C+ to come in clutch . The rest of the grade breakdown is 5% diagnostic quiz. 10% classwork/ quizzes. 20% midterm 1 , 25% midterm 2 , 30% final .Biggest advice get 100% on your webassigns and do well on classwork and quizzes this is an easy 1/4 of your grade you can secure.Study your ass off for midterm 1 and 2 unlike me who got below the average on both of these exam . And it was looking like a D+ was life for me . However in the last 3 weeks of school during finals I attended office hours with Matt Gagne and he blew my mind. He explains confusing topics in such simple terms and glazes over the stuff you don’t need to know. Also just a super interesting guy who is ridiculous smart.Overall I would strongly recommend taking Matt Gagne as a professor. At times you won’t know what he’s talking about but if you attend office hours he will explain it simply for you . Also do all the previous exams possible as they reuse questions all the time . And no matter how hard you’ve prepared the final is always impossible . I somehow managed to get my C+ and don’t really understand how.Attend Matts lectures they are fun and engaging and he usually lets you out early . Also he’s probably the only professor at UVA who vapes indoors so that’s a must see . Calc 2 is really a simple course which is just teaching you statements and methods of calculus then testing you to see if you understand them on the exams . If you just write down what they want to see and keep it simple you’ll do fine . Good luck my children !"

However, if you have to take this course because of your major, Matthew isn't a terrible teacher.  He does his best to answer your questions in class, but teaches pretty fast so pay attention. He'll do web assign problems on the board and basically give you the answers.  Since you don't have to do the webassign to do the webassign (i.e. practice another version) my biggest advice would be to actually try doing the webassigns on your own. This way you know exactly what you don't know and can ask him to go over it in class. The textbook is mildly helpful as well for the webassigns and you could always go to office hours. There are about two webassigns per week.  He also assigns written homeworks and classwork which he grades pretty leniently and you're allowed to work with others on these. I thought both midterms were pretty difficult and they weren't like the practice exams. I took math 1210 and if you did one practice exam, you were pretty much golden for the actual exam but that wasnt the case for 1220.  I got the average for both midterms and there was a pretty generous curve for both. When it came to the final I was really nervous, but it didnt end up being so bad and i was able to get a B in the class."

Take calc with him if you can.\nThis class has stuff due every week. Before tests, do the webassigns and practice tests multiple times and the real test will be similar. They tend to use the trick questions on exams, so don't skip them in practice thinking you'll be fine. There is a decent curve. Make a groupchat for a study group, and you'll end with a good grade"

He is extremely kind, patient, and clearly loves teaching math. He comes off as timid and quiet at first (beware, he does have a very quiet voice and does't use a microphone, and that paired with his slight Russian accent can make class a little difficult sometimes) but he seriously will go above and beyond for his students. He is always encouraging us to ask whatever questions we have during class, and no matter the question, he will take the time to make sure it is answered and understood. If you email him or take the  time to go to office hours, he will do the absolute most he can to help you. I seriously believe that if you take the time to get help, there is no way that you won't end up with the grade you want in his class.  Also, you WILL understand math more from being taught by this guy, which was very very helpful for me, personally. 11/10 would recommend taking a math class with Dmitriy, ESPECIALLY if you are not a math person, and are just looking to get a requirement out of the way.

I had to use the textbook, office hours, and YouTube professors (Professor Leonard is GREAT), in order to really understand the material. Exam 1 is easy, but exam 2 is IMPOSSIBLE. The final was very fairly written. Based on experiences I have heard of with other professors, I would say you can't get much better than Dmitriy. He truly cares about each of his students and if you visit him in office hours you will understand the material better.

Class consisted of him giving us packets with practice problems on them and flinging us into breakout rooms to struggle together without really teaching the material beforehand. With that being said, as long as you show up to lecture and make sure to understand every problem in the packets after the fact, you will do well on exams it's just a matter of putting in the effort."

Rolf is a pretty nice guy and he clearly cares about his students, but at the same time I feel like he thinks struggling is an integral part of learning. Besides that, he is very approachable in office hours and willing to help. While he is less likely to hand out answers in comparison to other profs, he tries to guide students to the answer. The hw isn't bad at all, but the class prep assignments are sometimes annoying. The worst part of the class is the problem sets, which take HOURS UPON HOURS. I definitely recommend working with other people, but once you're done with problem set, the answers seem a lot clearer and prepare you more for exams (the exam questions aren't as hard or as long but the problem sets help you understand the material more). Quizzes and exams aren't toooo bad. There may be an upward curve on quiz grades at the end of the semester because Rolf tends to give out harder quizzes, but they're doable. Exams suck but if you prepare e.g. do the hw, the class prep, go over quizzes and practice exams, you will be fine. The exams seemed comparable to the pain of math 1210. Personally, I thought the problem sets were the worst part of the class. Overall, calc 2 isn't the best but it's not the absolute worst. Rolf is a decent professor but I would recommend supplementing your knowledge with outside sources as well. For context, I got an A in this class and math is usually my worst subject."

The only thing that can possibly save your grade in the class are the web-assign, midterms, and final which in comparison to his quizzes and written homework are an absolute cake wake.  Still getting a 95% > on all three combined assignments (make sure to keep your web-assign at 100% as it is an easy free booster) does not make up for the near 60% avg you will have on your written hw and quizzes (20% of your grade) so aiming for an A or A- is far from easy and essentially impossible.  Going to office hours for explanations on the written hw  is seemingly useless as despite going through every single problem with him for the written hw you would still end up with getting a C through F grade. The worst realization however is when you walk into the exams and chat with people in other classes and hear \"what are you talking about? We don't get written homework and our web-assigns are generally  short, like around 15-20 questions.\" numbers and statements that I would have never associated with my Applied Calc II class with Weaver."

He is very tough and makes this makes the actual exams (which are the same for all sections) a joke. His class is boring too, but I feel like all math classes are boring.

His in-class quizzes are not too bad if you understand the Webassign homework due the Sunday before the quizzes are administered. Where this course really falters is the exams; they are not made by the students but rather the department. As a result, sometimes the material does not align and sometimes the applications on the exam are way beyond what we did in class. Ultimately, try to avoid this class if possible. However, if you need to, take it with Gabe no matter what."

I really appreciated the group classwork we did once a week because when we got to more difficult sections,  it was nice to know that I wasn't the only one struggling with it.  And if other people in the class didn't seem to think things were hard, I would know to spend more time on those chapters.  The webassigns were pretty difficult for some chapters but they do prepare you for exams, so make sure you do all of them (they're easy points that you should take advantage of).  I would also recommend starting the practice exams as soon as they are posted because its really important that you get through all of them before taking the midterms/final so you know what to expect.  The practice exams were especially  helpful before the final because I was having a rough time with Taylor Series at the end of the semester (like everyone lol) and I spent a long time going over examples in the textbook and online.  The night before the final I did all the taylor series questions on the practice finals to make sure I knew how to do them.  Then, the actual final ended up having a ton of those kind of questions so I got really lucky,  Overall, this class can be super challenging at times but Brian was super approachable and really wanted all of us to do well."

Be ready to take some time to do the webassigns before the day they are due so that you can ask questions if you get stuck on them, and if you struggle with the written homework he is very helpful in his office hours. If you go through the study guides and take all of the practice tests before each midterm/final you should perform to your potential. I found that they were pretty consistent in difficulty to the real ones. Definitely a challenging class but if you take it with Gates you will at least have a prof that cares about his students and is fair, unlike some of the horror stories I've heard about some of the other teachers."

If you have to take MATH 1220- I would recommend taking it with Mike Willis! Just make sure you do really well on the midterms because the cumulative final (same exam for all sections) is EXTREMELY HARD! Much harder than the midterms/homework/notes.

Every single day he has had connection issues and various other problems because he uses some old iPad to teach the class. Obviously there's a problem if every single day there is lag on the screenshare and a bunch of pop-ups blocking the screen. All you have to do is get on a computer????? Literally half the class we just sit here as he tries to figure it out. I already know we are going to be incredibly crunched for time in the future. As for actual class material, his notes are pretty bad. Absolutely bare-bones with minimal information and sometimes even misinformation with incorrectly calculated solutions. Thankfully I have some background knowledge on the class or I'd be screwed. Don't take unless you want to just sit there for 4 hours learning material by yourself every day. I'll update the review once we've had the first exam... can't wait for that. I'm sure you all are familiar with webassign so I dont even need to go into how bad that is. As for the homeworks he makes up, they make no sense. I sat down with 3 of my classmates and all 4 of us thought the problems made no sense. They were poorly worded and overly difficult with at least half of the problems almost unrelated to what we did during class time.  Also makes you go in blind to every single quiz and test. No reviews, no study sheets, no anything. At this point I might as well have taken regular calc 2. There seems to be no difference."

It's a class that you can work extremely hard for and still do very poorly. That said, go to office hours as much as possible. John is very helpful in office hours and will take a lot of time to help you succeed. Written homeworks were super hard, but the quizzes and WebAssigns were manageable. Exams were awful. Grades on the final were horrible and the department didn't curve it. Just try to get points where you can on the test.

The lectures will become entirely useless and it's up to the students to learn the material themselves. Socolovsky definitely knows his stuff and is knowledgable when you go to his office hours, but the lectures are very dry, slow, and he has a hard time prioritizing what should be covered in class. The most mundane things get extra time getting covered in a single problem (like why he used chain rule), and then much harder sections of the same problem just get thrown up on the board without an explanation. He also has a tendency to either write out every single step (including very unnecessary ones) and then other times skipping steps and simplifying parts in his head. Again, throwing it on the board afterwards without an explanation.\nFor the times when someone is able to flag him down to ask the necessary questions, the language barrier gets in the way again and he points to the wrong sections on the board, the student has to say \"No, right, right, up, yes, that one\" and he still somehow spends 20 minutes explaining the wrong step. At this point students give up on the question and move on. Repeat ad nauseam. He also spends a ridiculous amount of class time on proofs, and not enough time on the actual material and application of said material. I sat near the front of the class every lecture and talked to the other students who sat in the front and they all had a very difficult time understanding him. The ones who spent the time outside of class learning the material by themselves were the ones who got a good grade.\nYou may think this review is slightly exaggerated, but please take my word and don't take it with this professor. You will have a much easier and better time with a better professor. Taking him because he fit my schedule was a mistake, and I should've prioritized my calc class schedule over the others first."

There are 2 midterms worth 20% each and a final worth 30%. The rest of the grades come from online homework and 3-4 scheduled quizzes throughout the semester. The best way to study for the exams is definitely by using past exams with their solutions."

The class is taught be a graduate student, which is for starters a red flag. I appreciate them trying their best, but they are just not equipped with the knowledge and experience to teach a college level calc class to us. I 10000000% think if I had a real professor instead of a graduate student my grade would have been significantly higher. TO be honest, the undergrad TA is really the only reason I even passed this class. To summarize what she emphasized, exam questions are practically the same as the practice exam ones and the 'extra problems' in the notes, so be sure to do those. The one thing I really was pleased with in this class was that even if you did not know how to solve a problem, you can write what you know and what is relevant (literally just words) and receive partial credit for understanding."

I decided I'd take the \"slightly harder\" math course, MATH 1310. Big mistake.\nIf I could go back and choose my classes for this semester, I would have definitely chosen MATH 1190 or even 1210. Not to mention, I'm not sure if this was a problem unique to MATH 1310 Canvas page, but while a lot of resources were offered (practice worksheets and problems, uploaded class notes, etc.) everything was hard to find and disorganized making my experience in this course harder than it had to be. I hope they fix this for future students since many of my peers spoke up about it this semester.\nMoreover, this course is overseen by the professor, Daniel James, who directs 3 other non-professor instructors. They all have their own classes that they teach, and I was one of the students placed under the instruction of a graduate student. I'm sure in some cases, classes taught by graduate students may be a good idea, but I wish I had been placed in the professor's class. Many, if not all, of the concepts in this class, were previously taught to me in high school, but I feel like the way things were taught in this course was more complicated than needed. Maybe it was because my instructor saw these concepts as simple as addition, making it easy to forget to break them down before moving on to the next problem.\nOverall, I didn't have the best experience in this course. What I have learned, is that if you can take an easier course to fulfill a requirement, TAKE THE EASIER COURSE. If you do end up taking this class anyway, I recommend you never skip the professor's office hours (I felt that he explained everything the best) and DEFINITELY find a good study group early on!"

First off, I would have done so much better if Professor Daniel James was my actual professor. If you end up having Pedro, though he is a nice guy, he does not teach well at all. He is a graduate student and does not really know how to prepare his students for the assessments. Also the difference in standard and growth based is so unfair and I did not have a good experience with this class at all. I recommend taking the lower level calc class if you need it for a prerequisite. I never want to take a calc class ever again.\nAgain, Daniel James is great and his office hours were super helpful.

I took this class as a first year thinking that it was the same as MATH 1210, as they are both seemingly equal prerequisites for many popular majors such as Economics, Commerce, and Biology.\nHowever, this is far from the case. This class is much more theoretical and trig-intensive in its approach to calculus, and it demands a much more nuanced knowledge of the subject than MATH 1210. TAKE MATH 1210 INSTEAD.\nEvery other problem on the exams is a multi-step application of topics in the course, while MATH 1210 problems are typically a slight variation of what is given in class. The graduate students that teach these classes are largely apathetic in lecture, so office hours are crucial. If possible, meet with Daniel James frequently. He is the course coordinator and is the best at clearly and patiently explaining the topics and helping students formulate an approach to studying that is best for their learning style. Most of the work in this class was associated with pre-class homeworks and WebAssign, but I spent the bulk of my time that was dedicated to this class by studying for exams.\nThis course is a far cry from high school math. I went into this class having taken math through linear algebra in high school and MATH 1310 severely humbled me. It is largely the same concepts as high school classes, but the way in which it is 'taught' (flipped classroom style) and the level of understanding they demand for students to show on exams is above and beyond what you will have seen in high school. TAKE MATH 1210."

The material isn't anything impossible, but it is all very in depth and you need a really good understanding of the material to do well. And because the class is taught by a grad student, I found my lectures to be nearly worthless. I basically taught myself everything I had to know from youtube and chat GPT. My grad student teaching the classes was a smart and nice guy, but he has no idea how to teach a class. Sometimes he would make mistakes on the board and we would have to correct him, sometimes he would write out long unnecessary proofs that would just confuse us even more.\nThe best way to do well is to have background knowledge from an actual teacher. If you don't, beware that you will probably need to teach yourself a lot on your own. Do the homeworks and really understand them, don't just get the answer without knowing why it is right.

Not only is the class structure of talking at you called \"interactive\" and \"engaging\" by the professors, the outside help that sought for it made me less confident about my knowledge of the material. I personally would not recommend this if you have absolutely no experience in calculus like me, unless you are willing to do 90% of the teaching on your own. If you're struggling in this class, I would highly recommend using ChatGPT, Khan Academy, and P2L sessions to pick up the slack that the professors leave. Good luck!"

The grading scale is based off near-perfection, and although the course is said to be \"growth based,\" the retakes are often completely different problems/types of problems then the original exam problems. Additionally, you need to earn almost all 4s on all learning targets by the end of the semester to get an A in the class. The final exam questions count as NEW questions (learning targets) which you can not retake, so you basically need to get 100% (all 4s) to have a shot/cushion at getting an A in the class, regardless of whether you're going into the final with all 4s or not. Further, there are \"core targets\" and you MUST have 4/4 on all 5 of them by the end of the semester, otherwise you will automatically be bumped down essentially a letter grade: if someone has 4 4/4 and 1 core target less than a 4, the highest grade you can earn in the course is a B+, regardless of whether or not all your other learning targets are prefect 4/4s.\nAn interesting change early on in the semester, was that the course coordinator did not allow instructors to see the exams before giving them. This was certainly interesting to us because the course coordinator teaches her own section of this class and can ultimately teach directly to the exams (that she creates) while other instructors can not. This is strange because the instructors are PhD students, and their reviews or student outcomes in their classes could potentially impact their success in their programs...???\nIf you need to take THIS SPECIFIC CLASS (and there is no way you can take an alternative like survey 1210) as a pre-req for your major, I would recommend doing the following: pay VERY close attention during class, ask a lot of questions and identify learning gaps as they come, NOT just right before exams, and study at least a week leading up to each exam by doing lots of different types of practice problems, since you never really can predict which type of example problem will be on the exams. Your instructors are ultimately here to help you and really do care about you, and they are knowledgable. DEVELOP STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM!!!!!! It will really help you. If you have to take this class, you will succeed and you will be ok, but be prepared to do a substantial amount of studying and extra work outside of class."

Arguably, the work isn't even that hard, they just grade it so bizarrely and harshly, and you will probably end up tanking your GPA (esp. because 1310 is 4 credits rather than 1210, which is 3) if you can't take advantage of the slightly easier final.  Be prepared to submit a LOT of regrade requests and get a LOT of them denied. My instructor was a really nice guy who hated how the class was graded but couldn't do anything about it.\nMy school didn't do APs but I was good at math in highschool and this course KICKED MY ASS.

His teaching is methodical and mathematical, and he sincerely cares about your success and understanding. I originally disliked his teaching style, but it grew on me -- so, give it time. In order to be successful in this class, you need to understand the concepts and ideas; you cannot memorize a formulaic approach to problems because the ones on the tests will be different from those done on homework and class activities.

Although he did not go through each type of problem included in the class work packets, he was very approachable during office hours. The exams are not as high stress as you would expect due to the weighting of grades. Be sure to complete your class preps and homework (WebAssign) on time and participate in Poll Everywhere during class - it is easy to get a 100 in these assignments.\nI put in a significant amount of effort into this class and found it most rewarding.

IMPORTANT: there are multiple calc 1 courses, no one told me about survey of calc 1 (MATH 1210) at orientation, so I signed up for this class thinking it was the same thing...it is not. 1210 is a broader scope of calc 1 content and (from what I have heard) is easier than 1310. If you can take 1210, take 1210. I still do not quite understand the benefit of taking the more in depth course, so make sure to check it out/talk to an advisor before signing up.\nThat being said, DJ is an amazing professor. I attended a number of review sessions hosted throughout the semester that were run by some of the other professors and found their teaching methods far more confusing and indirect than DJs. I also found that DJ was genuinely interested in his students success. He gladly answers all questions, responds to emails in a timely manner, and never made me feel bad about asking him to repeat himself. In conclusion if you go for 1310, take it with DJ.\nNow for the grading. This semester there were two different methods of grading, Traditional and Growth. At first everyone was freaking out about which grading method would result in getting a higher grade, but I honestly do not think it really mattered. There are pros and cons to each type of grading, so do not be too worried about ending up in one type vs. the other. I was in the traditional section which had 5 midterms in total ( 2 worth 20% each and 3 worth 1.6% each), a final exam (worth 25%), and the remaining percent was fluff (homework, preparation, etc.). I highly recommend taking the 1.6% midterms seriously since they do a good job of preparing you for the 20% midterms. To do well you should start studying AT LEAST a week in advance. The grading can be harsh and the problems are challenging. The graders also gave quite a bit of partial credit if you showed that you understood what was going on and made a viable attempt. While the midterms were hard, I didn't find anything unreasonable."

The content is organized pretty well, but the flipped classroom structure (you learn the content initially as homework and review in class) is kind of annoying. The class has clear deadlines and structures and not too much homework though. I will say the exam structure is a little stupid. There are learning targets for each topic and on the exams, there is only one question per learning target, so you either show that you know it or it gives off the impression that you don't know it at all if you get the question wrong. Dounia was an alright professor, but I definitely wish I had a professor with more teaching experience (not her fault though; I think a lot of MATH 1310 professors this semester are grad students). She is very nice and understanding though, and the class environment is very chill. #tCFfall22"

He goes pretty slow, and recaps the class before at the start of every class. My only complaint about him as a teacher is the discussion section is supposed to be for students to ask questions, and go over the most confusing part about the week, but he goes so slow during the week, that he turned our discussion into another lecture. That can be a pro to some people, or a con depending on how you see that. Now about the class, the exams are hard. They take the concepts learned in class and escalate them, but if you do the practice exams you should be okay. Just make sure to study a lot for them.#tCFspring2022"

            "text": "I believe that most of the professors for MATH 1310 are grad students, so keep in mind that my review is only specific to Don Phillips' class. He was a super nice and understanding instructor, and clearly enjoyed teaching. If he felt like he didn't do a good job in class or had an \"off\" day, he would type up an extra set of more thorough notes or re-explain during the next class just to make sure we didn't suffer from his self-perceived shortcomings. I swapped into his class from another, but even the other instructor had been super nice and entertaining. My friends who took MATH 1310 with other instructors also had great things to say about theirs, so I wouldn't worry too much about which instructor you choose, as most of the issues I describe seem to be a common trend among the majority of the school's Calculus instructors (even for the APMA calc courses).\nThe only classwork we had were questions in the notes (only collected for grading on occasion) and on WebAssign (some weeks had more assigned WebAssigns than others, but you can work ahead so it's not so unbearable. You can also request multiple automatic 24hr extensions on the site for every assignment that isn't class-prep for Don's class). You get a grade for taking notes on the class-prep assignments on WebAssign, and we had 3 quizzes during our worksop over the semester. We had 2 midterms and an exam. Most people I knew did pretty poorly on the first exam (65% or less with the curve), but they curved the grades on both. I hadn't studied on the first and got a 57% post-curve, and actually studied for the second to get an 81% post-curve (again, most people felt like they did pretty bad after this, but I did not compare grades with anyone on this exam so maybe they did better than expected). I took a year-round AP Calculus AB course in 11th grade, and this class was still pretty challenging since I'd forgotten how to work through most of the material. If you have no experience in Calculus, brace yourself.\nAs previously mentioned, so many people had a lot of difficulty with the exams which my peers and I chalked up to the structure of the classes. The whole MATH 1310 shares class notes (called \"class activities\") which is why this is a problem for a majority of classes regardless of which grad student you choose for an instructor. The class notes questions are usually very simple, and only the group questions (meant to be completed with your table) are thought-provoking. Don Phillips did a pretty nice job at explaining how to solve problems, but I felt like he lacked the \"why\" in solving problems. Because practice questions were so easy and the concepts weren't always discussed in-depth, the test questions would catch people completely off-guard. They required more conceptualization and a deeper understanding of the topics, which we did not get from notes and certainly did not get from the WebAssigns. However, the MATH 1310 department also publishes a ton of practice exams with keys on Collab, which is why I got an 81% on the second midterm. Walking out, everyone was complaining of the difficulty, but I had felt pretty confident (even though I did spend hours working through all of the published midterm 2 exams from previous years).\nOverall, this class may be hard to succeed in since midterms and the final exam make up a combined 65% of your final grade, especially without previous experience in Calculus. If you need help, most of the instructors I met seemed extremely approachable and capable of offering help during office hours."

For starters, he uses the free trial of some screenshare program which has pop-ups approximately every 5 minutes covering his notes, and he relies on students interrupting lecture to tell him to close them. Mark is also extremely unaccommodating and frankly rude in how he handles questions about both content and extensions. He takes about three to four days to respond to emails on average, and most of the time he keeps his responses very brief and vague. The only grades he posts on his gradebook are exam scores, and the rest of the grades are not accessible to students, even if you email him (he didn’t even bother to respond to my email about my final grade)! Overall, I do not recommend taking MATH 1310 with him to anyone, as although I ended up doing pretty well in his class, he single-handedly managed to ruin my calculus experience at UVA and is the reason I will not be continuing on to MATH 1320 next semester.\n#tCF2020"

She is extremely helpful in class and during office hours and genuinely cares about her students' success. There's a ton of extra credit opportunities offered in the class (it's tallied up into a formula and then added to each respective exam) and it's not that hard to get the extra points (doing weekly reflections, completing online homework at least 24 hours early, etc). That being said, the exams are relatively hard, testing you on APPLICATION of what you learned in class with a pretty fair curve.WARNING: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN CALCULUS IN HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE. You may be better suited in Math 1210 or a pre-calculus type of course here. Math 1310 is a theory-based Calculus course that goes beyond common concepts learned in high school. I definitely saw a lot of overlap between what I learned in Calc I in high school vs. Math 1310 here, however, you definitely build upon that prior knowledge with a lot of theory analysis on what seem like \"common concepts.\" I STRONGLY SUGGEST you only take this course if you NEED IT--do some research on what you're looking at majoring in and if it requires you take Math 1310 (typically Math, Science-based majors...) then take it, if not, OPT FOR 1210 (if you even need Calc at all). I wish I knew this coming in, but ended up wanting to major in something that required 1310 as a prerequisite anyways, so I was lucky.All of that being said, if you NEED to take Math 1310 for any reason, TAKE IT WITH VERONICA. She really helped when I was struggling at the beginning given the pace of the course and even lets you redo assignments/give extensions if need be. She's super understanding and just wants to see her students succeed. She's also super passionate and attempts to make the class fun/interesting (whenever possible). I've heard friends with other Math 1310 instructors that haven't had quite as pleasant of an experience as me, and I really believe it has to do with Veronica. Super lenient and super enjoyable instructor, just be wary of how difficult the class can get and utilize her office hours!"

Veronica is really passionate about math and loves to teach it and explains everything very thoroughly. She is a tough grader on the quizzes but that's very helpful because then you learn about how specific you have to be on the tests and she wants you to excel. I probably put in maybe 2-3 hours a week during class and studied 30min prior to quizzes and a day or two before tests and ended up with an A so as long as you understand and decipher the material and go to class you'll do fine.

However, this calculus gets very specific and problems are heavy with trigonometry (instead of just taking the derivative of a function, the function has trig elements making it trickier). The grading is hard in the sense that if you forget certain things (like you do not carry the limit through your work) you lose points. The homework on WebAssign is tedious busy work that will take up time during your week. However, if you do it, it is an easy 100% for 10% of your grade. Another 10% comes from weekly quizzes that are short with two problems. If you study for these you can easily end up with a 90+% for this section. There are 5 \"Written HW\" that account for another 10% of your grade. These are much harder problems but can be done in a group. Go to office hours and you basically get the answers and 100%. The midterms and final are what tripped me up! The first midterm I overestimated my high school calculus knowledge and went into it blindly. TAKE THE PRACTICE EXAMS and STUDY! It will help you. I did better on the second midterm because I did this. The final was hard for everyone. If your teacher does exam credit points through in class worksheets or answering/asking questions on Piazza do that! Those exam credit points will save you! Even though I got 76% on the first midterm and final exam, I ended up with a B (almost a B+) just because I kept up with the workload for the other areas of the class."

Solving worksheet problems, posting on Piazza, turning in homework early) and the tests are curved generously (I’m not sure if that’s a math department decision or a professor decision). Piazza (discussion board) saved me. You get extra credit on exams for posting and answering questions, and it’s a great way to ask other students for help with homework. Also, the homework is online and most problems have tutorials. The grading and type of coursework is difficult to explain because when we switched from in-person to online, the types of assignments and their weights changed. There is an online reading and class prep assignment due before class each day. In class Veronica reviews what you learned in the class prep assignment, then the class gets into groups and works on practice problems. There is also written homework (about 3 or 4 of those) and online homework due every Sunday (complete the homework by midnight on Saturday and you get 10% extra credit on most problems). Originally, there were quizzes, two midterms, and a final. After the switch to Zoom, the quizzes and second midterm were combined into two Quests (so basically long quiz / short test). Exams were open note once we switched to the online format. Veronica puts solutions for class worksheets, quizzes, written homework, tests, and quests on Collab. She also provides practice problems to study for exams. DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS. I never did them, and my life would have been so much easier if I had practiced and studied more.

MATH 1310 is not for the faint of heart - I had taken Calc AB and BC in high school, and did decently on both. I expected this class to be easier as a result, but I was very wrong. It is very, very, theoretical and often borderline esoteric, making problems unnecessarily difficult and tests extremely hard.\nIf you must take this class, take it with Ted! He is an amazing teacher. He is caring, understanding, and always willing to help.  He's great at explaining and is genuinely there to help you get through and be the best at math you can be. Highly recommend Ted, do not recommend the class."

I absolutely detest this format and find it impossible to learn anything. A lot of the time, the prep assignments don't teach you what you need to know to succeed in the class and things are very rarely explained before you have to dive into group work together. Our teacher was great and really did his best (he's really great Ted is the best), but the class is meant to be very self driven and self taught and I personally found that impossible to manage. I have taken (and succeeded in) calculus before but found this class incredibly difficult to manage, and can't imagine being successful in it without that calculus background. But even then, I still only understand about 50% of the material we are presented with. I do not recommend taking this class unless you *absolutely* have to."

Students would often have to come to the front of the class to help HIM solve a problem when another student initially asked the question. WebAssigns, classwork(assigned group work the entire class time instead of teaching), and homework(group p sets) did not even vaguely match up to exams. Didn’t care if students learned anything at all. He laughed multiple times at a student who was seriously sick and coughing loud enough for the entire auditorium to hear during an exam(they were told they couldn’t come in at a later date). Not sure how denying someone a reasonable request and laughing at them later is amusing in any sense of the imagination. Extremely unhelpful during office hours as he would spend hours trying to explain a convoluted p set he assigned students for homework, while it was not even correlated to exams or even a WebAssign at that. Not sure how he is still \"teaching\", recommend any of the other TAs. A lot worse reviews were previously here - guess things are getting deleted when they are a little too true? Students are PAYING for this, we should have legitimate professors."

He is extremely passionate about teaching, and definitely makes you think to uncover the answer. However, I can easily see that if you hadn't taken calculus before or aren't the strongest math person, that his teaching style can be confusing. His office hours are rather empty, I strongly recommend attending them. Put in the work and you'll be fine!"

The final was on the same level as the second midterm. He never tells the average, but it was likely around 70%. There is a slight curve, but it is small. Don't rely on it. Lecture is extremely boring, and he tends to complicate things. If you are on a pre-comm track, just take Applied Calc 1. Don't be a fool and think that you are showing more effort by taking regular calc 1. It's not worth it."

Take the homework seriously, you will need to put in a lot of effort if you are slightly above average at math like me. The lectures are important, but he goes so fast and doesn't label things so they are very, very hard to follow. My notes from lecture are pretty useless to me. You don't need to buy the book, you can if you want, but online math tutorials worked better for me. Take at your own peril because this isn't AP calc boys and girls."

Professor Rolf is very approachable in class and in office hours and wants you to succeed. I can't say that the class was always enjoyable, since it was rather brutal at times, but this was from the material itself and not because of Professor Rolf. In my experience I especially struggled with shell method integration at the beginning of the semester and Taylor series toward the end. You'll generally have two video lectures with short \"prep problem\" sets, two longer homework sets, in-class questions, and a quiz to do each week. Starting a few weeks into the semester you'll have written homework sets due every other week. If you're a STEM major, you most likely are required to take this class, but take it with Professor Rolf if you can to make things better."

We also had quizzes almost every week during the discussion sections, and his quizzes can be on the harder side sometimes, so make sure you prepare for them!\nHe holds extra office hours for us near exams season, and he tries to make himself available for us outside of his normal office hours as well! He is extremely patient and understanding, and genuinely cares about his students' success. Additionally, he tried to connect with students on a personal level as well -- he became more like a friend as the semester progressed.

He is a fantastic instructor, able to make complicated things seem simple. He listened to our input and really listened to our questions and answered them in detail. You will never feel like you don't belong in his classroom. Not only is he great at teaching the concepts, but he also values each and every one of his students for who they are as people. He truly wanted to get to know us and also cared about how we were doing as people, always understanding if we needed an extension or some extra help because we were sick or just in a bad place. This was my first semester in college, and I never could have imagined having a professor that cares so deeply about the students academically and as human beings. Beyond that, he makes class enjoyable with his sense of humor and teaching style. If you are able to, I highly recommend taking this class with Professor Gates.The class itself definitely poses some difficulty, and things like webassign and prep videos definitely got annoying, but class itself was always engaging and enjoyable. The exams are hard, so studying for those is important (I learned that the hard way) but it is definitely doable and the professors do try to make all of the work fair.Just to reiterate, ZACH GATES IS AMAZING AND YOU WILL LOVE TAKING THIS CLASS WITH HIM! Truly an amazing professor and human being."

He doesn't assume that you fully understand the topics from the prep-videos, and takes the time in class to answer questions and explain concepts. Most importantly, Zach creates a classroom environment in which everyone feels welcome and included. Outside of the classroom, Zach hosts frequent office hours to walk through homework, review assessments, or just talk. One of the best things about this course is that by the end of it I felt I truly knew Zach as a person and as a friend. You can really tell that he genuinely cares about his students. Don't be mistaken, the class is still a lot of work. It takes time and practice to master the concepts covered in the course. I routinely put 7+ hours a week into the class, between WebAssign homework and studying for the weekly quizzes. However it is very manageable if you work hard and plan it out, something Zach is more than willing to help you make happen."

He knows his stuff, and always makes an effort to answer questions to the best of his ability. The exams are pretty difficult but doing the practice exams that the professor provides helps a LOT.  If you have a solid foundation in high school math and Calc 1, you will do well in this class.  Networking with your classmates is also a very beneficial way to make sure you understand the material to the best of your ability.  Also, make sure to keep up with the WebAssigns and the written homework, as they will help you tremendously on the weekly quizzes and exams."

He is such a nice and funny guy and really tries to make sure that you understand everything. Not once did he make anyone feel inferior for asking clarification questions, he was always super supportive. Towards the end of the semester, around finals, I got sick and asked Prof. Sonkin what would happen if I was unable to take the final. He explained that there are other avenues we can work through if I am unable to take it during the allotted time. Luckily, I was able to take it in person, but what was so amazing is that Prof. Sonkin approached me in the final testing hall while passing out final exams and asked me if I was feeling better with a smile coming out from under the mask. Such a genuine guy, would absolutely recommend taking the course with him. As for the class itself, easily the hardest class I have ever taken (took it first semester of first year for reference), but when the teacher is fun and nice, it makes it way more tolerable. Prof. Sonkin is also a very reasonable grader. The tests were pretty difficult for me, though there are some people I know who did very well on all of them so it is definitely possible. If you have to take Calc 2, it's going to be difficult and time consuming, but this is definitely the guy to take it with. I can promise he'll make you smile every week."

I went to Rolfs office hours once or twice and learned nothing - its clear Rolf is smart but he could not communicate anything to my level of understanding, and he made videos we had to watch for the course which I stopped watching bc they had nothing to do with the class. Sonkin says u dont need a textbook, but I LIVED by that thing. Would definitely recommend getting a paper textbook if u can afford it as the online one is hard to use. Before I decided to rent a textbook, I actually checked out a couple random calc books from the library bc they all teach similar ways and that was helpful I just had to search the books a little more since it wasnt what the prof used. So compared to Rolf, Sonkin is AMAZING. It took me a little bit to get used to his accent, but definitely don't let something as small as that discourage you. All calc ii classes move really quickly but I wish Sonkin involved us more in discussion instead of him quickly walking through it but hes always happy to answer questions and be available to help. U definitely have to be paying attention in lecture. He really cares about his students, but his quizzes are way harder than other professors, though he would drop hints during class like are you surreeeeee you dont have questions about this? He pushed harder, but I think I was more prepared for exams. Definitely do the practice exams before a real one...web assigns arent really related to the exam for some reason. I liked McCarthy's office hours (and I think his quizzes were more straightforward) and the Math Collaborative Learning Center (MCLC) - I went pretty much every day to work on my homework because that is where another student working at the MCLC would take more time to explain things (especially if Marco and Casia are there!). This class is just ridiculously hard for no reason. I would definitely say the lectures are supplementary in that if u don't figure out/understand basics before lecture (which I would do at the MCLC), you might get lost. Also, I hadn't taken calc ii before and it was clear some people had already taken ap calc bc in high school so ask the \"dumb\" questions because the person \"easily\" understanding it next to you is probably hearing it for the second time."

There is a lot of work and you have to do all of it. It'll often make zero sense. UVA offers a lot of support for math, so really take advantage of it. However, Matt is one of the nicest, most understanding teachers I've met. He teaches math pretty well and is entertaining in his own special Matt way. All the 1320 lecturers get to design their own quizzes, and Matt's are some of the easiest. This makes the class far less stressful. I'm really sad Matt is leaving (if that is true), but I hope he has a great time in whatever life brings him in the future!"

Initially appearing challenging, it required a review of Calculus I content. Despite the difficulty stemming from a lapse in memory, adapting to the lecture style and instructor's accent made the course more manageable over time.\nThe instructor initially presented concepts with convoluted explanations, but this perception changed after adjusting to the teaching style. Our Learning Assistant, Sydney, played a crucial role during lectures, providing alternative interpretations and solutions when needed. The course became a breeze once these adjustments were made.\nRegular completion of WebAssign homework, despite occasional confusion, contributed to a deeper understanding of the concepts. Jim Rolf's supplemental videos and other assignments, such as problem sets and quizzes, were manageable with preparation. Connecting with classmates for questions and study sessions proved advantageous.\nExams, including two midterms with ample resources, were navigable. Additionally, a final (which I haven't taken yet) awaits. Office hours, MCLC, practice exams, P2L sessions, and Learning Assistant-led review sessions enhanced preparation.\nI recommend taking the course with Yuan Zhang!Despite initial challenges, achieving a desirable grade is possible with consistent effort and proper completion of assignments.\n#tCFF23"

Going to class was actually so fun because he always made so many jokes. I don't know if some of them were meant to be jokes but just is mannerisms were so fun. This class also is not that bad. The webassign homeworks are easy to get an 100 on, participation is easy, and written homeworks are easy. The weekly quizzes can be challenging because I personally never studied for them because they are so little of your grade. Also your lowest 3 get dropped. The exams are tough but fair. The professors give you old practice exams, and the exams they give you are just like the practice exams. They are more challenging than anything you do in class, but since they are just like the old ones I feel like its fair. I would just spend a lot of time studying for the exams and don't leave studying until the last minute, and you will be fine.#tCFspring2022"

Matt is an awesome professor and overall, I highly recommend taking Math 1320 with him. He made class fun and engaging, explained concepts well, and his overall demeanor was very conducive to learning. He is very approachable whenever you have questions, and I definitely recommend going to office hours — I only went once and regret not going more. In office hours, he is extremely helpful and I left much more knowledgable than I came in. Overall, I would highly recommend taking this course with Matt, but I would not sweat it if you are unable to find a spot in his section — instructor names are not usually available when registering for the course, and all sections take the same exams, complete the same prep questions, as well as the same homework."

He would sometimes get frustrated with the class if no one answered a question and one on one he could be a little intimidating and also get frustrated if it seemed like you were asking a dumb question. However, he was very available in office hours (would definitely recommend going) and by email, and seemed to generally care about his students.  A lot of his class was tied to the same standards as the rest of the 1320 classes and I'm not quite sure what was unique to him and what every class had to do.  Before every class we had to watch a prep video and complete a prep \"quiz\" on webassign (these were pretty much the same format as the homeworks on webassign but shorter). We also typically had two homeworks on webassign a week. Webassign allows multiple tries per problem and often gives videos of similar problems to solve or you can hit \"practice another\" to solve a similar problem and not waste your attempts on the real one. Usually you do not lose points per attempt except for a few homeworks in the middle of the semester that were mainly multiple choice so be on the lookout for that.  Webassigns do take quite a bit of time to work through so plan for that.  It can be very frustrating if you just don't know how to do something (and a lot of the problems are much more difficult than what is done in class). I highly recommend getting ahead on your webassigns so you can go to the MCLC to help with these.  There were also a few written homeworks that were counted in the same category as quizzes so you definitely wanted to do well on these to boost that grade and going to MCLC was a great option for that (and even office hours if you can get it started early enough).  In class, Dimou would pretty much just go through and annotate notes (that you can print out beforehand) and solve a few practice problems. He used learning catalytics to ask questions to the whole class (but these were only graded for participation). He also let us in breakout rooms for a bit at the end of class to begin our homework. During discussion there were usually quizzes every week with some exceptions. I felt like these got easier as the year progressed and were okay on time although harder than the class problems usually (except when he started giving us content from the day before on the quizzes and made it easy because of that). Finally, for tests, these were made by the coordinator of 1320 and Dimou and the other instructors did not know what was on them. They were pretty hard (a lot of problems that were more conceptual and could be solved quickly if you saw it right away but otherwise were a bit of a time crunch). There were 4 exams (the fourth was a non-cumulative final worth just as much as the other exams). Overall, if you have to take calc 2, survey is probably easier, but taking with Dimou is not a bad option."

The material is actually not that difficult to grasp and professor Maitra is actually a GOOD professor in so many ways. He understands the material (going to OH was very helpful), is very lenient in grading, and genuinely cares for his students. There's about 2-3 Web-assign homework problem sets due Sunday/Monday nights that take a bit of time. However, I will say that you can do the 'practice another' to find the solution OR if you manage to find the textbook solutions like I did, they follow the problem number. There was one quiz every Friday morning, although he ended up giving everyone 10/10 on three of the quizzes; instead of giving us quizzes, we would all just go over more problems that day and they were participation points. He truly understands that we are in a pandemic and every student is struggling.\nThe real problem is with the exams. Prof. Maitra does not make the exam taken in this class (I believe none of the instructors do, but some of the math department faculties do instead) and they are DIFFICULT. There's 3 exams in total + a final exam each worth 17.5%. My score of each exam gradually went down although I did do a lot better than I expected on the final. The class quizzes and Web-Assign problems are time consuming but are not that difficult. But the exams are just indescribably difficult and make no sense most of the time. Even though they give you practice exams + the solutions, the actual exams are like 20000x harder than what's on the practice. Also, there's three written home work problem sets to help 'prep' you for the exam but they don't even help and those are incredibly difficult as well. Do not take this class by yourself - make sure to take it with a few friends. Also, if you can, I highly recommend taking it with Prof. Maitra because he goes over a lot of materials and gives a lot of partial credit. Just make sure you have your pi circle and trig functions memorized prior to taking this class! #tCF2020"

He always says \"You'll have to show more work on the midterm\" but then doesn't go into detail about what the work is or what it looks like. Sometimes Aleksander would spend 30 minutes showing a problem to then say, \"Oh, sorry. Actually I did this problem wrong but no big deal...\" Most recently, Aleksander notified us that the study guide for the exam that accounts for 25% of your grade was one that was mistakingly sent from a few years ago. This was literally the day before the exam!\nI had Jiacheng Miao for my TA and he would give quizzes that hardly reflect what was even briefly talked about in lecture and he often refused to tell us what would be on the quiz until we got a few weeks into the semester.

He would give quizzes that hardly reflect what was even briefly talked about in lecture and he often refused to tell us what would be on the quiz until we got a few weeks into the semester. My main teacher even briefly mentioned how Jiacheng would send the quizzes for approval less than an hour before discussion and then would go ahead with it anyways regardless of if the teacher had points of contention with it. It got so bad that main teacher now shows up to our discussions to make sure that Jiacheng isn't telling us total BS. Also, you'll never know what Jiacheng is taking points off for because he never explains it. It's truly such a reassuring thought to know that he is part of the grading process for the exams and indiscriminately takes off points with zero consistency between people. He'll take off a point on one person's exam but not at all on anothers.\nIf he's your TA, hope you have a good professor to balance out. If they're both bad, please drop.

He is definitely in his own world when he teaches, as he dismisses students as if they are a liability rather than his students. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM. Our class average was almost 10% worse than the rest of the sections combined...THAT Is not a problem with the students, it is a problem with the teacher. HE is incoherent and most definitely incomprehensible. If it wasn't mid- November, I would withdraw...and if I could withdraw from this class I would. In all honesty, he's the worst Calc professor. I have gone to higher level math courses in my previous years, but he makes material so difficult to understand (material that I already know!). Thus, don't take Calc I with him, because there are far better professors out there that are willing to help his students. His accent and the speed with which he teaches classes makes it 100 times harder than it needs to be. HE's erratic, walking around during our exam, thinking and making huge hand gestures...it's distracting and unnecessary."

Atkinson is pretty good at explanations, but his lectures consist of copying the book to the board, which just won't work for some students as a teaching method, but it's at least adequate for seeing the book translated into a more consumable form. There are 10 minute quizzes at the end of discussion each week. Discussions are an opportunity to get more comfortable with the material with better explanations of the concepts. The TA, Mark Schrecengost, was really good at explanations and very helpful. There are three tests, which consist of two midterms and a final. The final was much harder than the previous two midterms. If you keep up with the homework, which can take a great deal of time to complete, and make sure you're comfortable with the material each week, you will do well on the tests."

Bourdon is a good teacher, very helpful with homework, and a fair grader. Exams are hard, no doubt about it, but he offers several study opportunities in advance for each one. I am not a particularly good math student, and I didn't do an outstanding amount of reading the textbook, but I went to class and discussion every single time and did all the homework to the best of my ability. I came out with a C, probably could have had a C+ if I really devoted myself to it. Tough course, but totally doable."

This Calculus class requires you to recognize recurring patterns from different topics and apply them in a single setting/question.Scott himself isn't too good a lecturer. He mumbles often and the topics he explains are often disjointed.  Do yourself a favor and pre-read the textbook to gain better understanding of the material before coming to class.  Nonetheless, his explanations become clearer by almost tenfold when you attend his office hours, so I recommend you do that.

He makes himself available in office hours many times a week and is patient and helpful if you come with questions.Calculus II itself is interesting but difficult. The homework and quizzes themselves are totally doable if you're dedicated and willing to get help at office hours. The homework assignments took me a long time, but I would often do them in one sitting. The exams though are wicked hard and much worse than the homework and quizzes, but they were curved by 20% or 30%. Work to get 100% on the homework and quizzes so that your exams don't wreck your grade.Conceptually, Calculus II is fascinating. As a class, it's difficult. Be ready to study hard for the exams because the questions are like challenge problems and don't just test concepts. If you love math, then take this class because  you'll probably love it. If you need calculus II as a requirement, then try to take Professor Franz because he's very good."

Homework is usually online and can be difficult at times when it doesn't quite match up with what we did in class, but it's do-able.

Kleski was fine, he knows the stuff and is organized and has really nice hand-writing. There was a online WebWork HW set every week in addition to a few harder written homework problems. Luckily I got 100% for the 30% of your final grade that HW is thanks to the Discussion section (seriously wouldn't have been able to do all the HW without it), but I ended up with a B+ in the class because there are tons of people in the class who have all seen the material before who mess up the one curve we got on a test, and the tests ask questions that were sometimes really unexpected and different than the HW and test review problems. I would REALLY suggest taking Applied Calc unless you absolutely can't because this class just isn't worth the pain."

The TA helped a ton on the problem sets. The professor was great, but it was necessary to go to office hours since he moved pretty quickly. I think I had a better time in 132 than most of my friends did in 122 because you don't get a TA in 122 or as personalized instruction. Kleski is a really nice guy.

However, Kleski is one of the best teachers here, considering it is one of the most failed classes at UVA.  Also:  if you fail the first exam, don't worry, it does get easier!

Chandra is really enthusiastic and open during his office hours, and his review sessions are helpful. He grades extremely leniently, so even though I got stuff wrong on the test I was able to get over 100%! There are two midterms and one final exam, mymathlab assignments usually once a week, and three written homeworks over the course of the semester. however, only one written homework is counted, and the top 10 averaged mymathlabs too. As long as you keep up with the web assigns, you'll be fine. This was my highest grade in my first semester of first year, and I'm so glad I took it.

At the end, our class had a curve such that an 85 was an A-, a 75- was a B- and so on, which was nice. If you forget to turn in homework once he usually takes it late anyways if you go to his office. Lowest quiz is dropped and for homework sets, he only takes off 1 point out of 100 for each wrong question (yes, that means if there's 20 questions and you show your work you'll at least get an 80 on it). I HIGHLY recommend reading the textbook thoroughly and doing extra problems from the same sections he assigns from. It's a short book, but it can basically teach you the material itself (what's covered in class doesn't really deviate from what's in the assigned reading at all)."

The weekly homework isn't that bad, but the weekly quizzes in the discussion section are hard to prepare for and can be annoying. That being said, unless you don't answer the questions at all, you'll be fine on the quizzes. The TA for the class was not great. He wasn't great at answering questions or explaining concepts, but there were a couple important things that I gained from the discussion section. The final wasn't terrible if you understand the concepts in the course (just don't make silly mistakes!), and I got an A in the class with an 85 on the final. I got a 78 on the midterm, but luckily he offered a kind of dutch knockout system where the final was either worth 40% or 70%.

But whether you are taking this class as a math major/minor or for simply rounding out your calculus understanding, I cannot recommend it enough. This class is a good bridge between more computational math and higher-level mathematics. You Qi focuses not just on computations but on actual understanding. He goes over proofs and has students do sort of pseudo-proofs on a few of the homework assignments.\nThis class takes a lot of time and is definitely hard, but it is ultimately very rewarding, and that is just the nature of the course. I recommend taking You Qi's advice and reading the sections of the book alongside the lectures. There is so much material, so sometimes the book is needed to supplement what is gone over in class. Also, don't feel bad if you feel lost sometimes in lecture. It does go really fast. But, office hours and the book make it very doable. And by the end, you will see how far you've come.\nAs for the tests, assessments in the course are quizzes, a midterm, and a final. Quizzes can be somewhat hard, and you really do only have ten minutes so reviewing the content from the week before taking them is helpful. But, they are ultimately fair and some are dropped. As for exams, these were more than fair. If you know the content going in, you will be fine. And You Qi let us have a cheat sheet as memorization is not the goal of the course. Further, I know in previous semesters when there were issues with exam difficulty, You Qi corrected them fairly. He is kind and generous.\nDefinitely take this course and take it with You Qi! Good luck on your math journey."

Nonetheless, Evangelos Dimou may be your best bet, since he's well-organized and will provide all the necessary tools for success. He teaches the textbook content in order, posts his worksheets and solutions online, and provides practice problems before midterms and exams. Additionally, instead of just solving random problems on the board each lecture, he provides everyone with a lesson sheet that teaches the valuable concepts and then reinforces them through simple practice problems. Besides that, there will be two weekly online hw assignments and a biweekly written hw. These will take about 30min - 1.5hr each to complete, but you'd probably have to study on your own otherwise, and they help ensure that you understand the content. Furthermore, the exams are straightforward, following similar problems to those done in class and being easier than the practice exam. The one caveat I have is that Mr. Dimou frequently asks the class simple questions as we're working along, like \"What's 1+3\", and if no one responds he'll abruptly stop and stare at the class like we're all idiots until someone responds. Nonetheless, this remains a fair and reasonable course, and although Mr. Dimou can't magically enlighten you with a calculus ability, he'll provide you with every necessary tool to learn it yourself."

Don't panic because you don't need to master imagining these until the end. He introduces it at the beginning so you don't get shocked and can't do any of the actual calculus. His exams are REALLY FAIR and he tells you what to expect on it. Pay attention in lecture and don't skip or you will be completely lost.\nTowards the end of the semester, he taught us an advanced method of doing the last few topics. He said that it will make calculations much simpler and it did. The way he teaches is great and if you go to office hours and ask questions he will try to explain things better.\nIf you ever confused, you can always send him an email and he will set an appointment with you but you have to take the initiative and start on the homework early so that you can ask him early on. Homeworks usually have one or two questions that are somewhat difficult and so start on the homework before the discussion session so you ask the TA questions.\nOverall, West is a great professor and wants to help his students as much as possible.

His explainations and proofs for concepts are intuitive most of the time (although if asked to explain what he proofed after class you would likely be saying I am not sure). He does not explain the concepts like most teachers. For example, for curl and divergence, he explained the concepts using mathematical topography (I forgot what it was called), so instead of showing us the geometric/physical meaning of those concepts, he derived it mathematically. That is kind of cool (but also not helpful for learning it). It would be extremely useful to preview the materials beforehand and perhaps follow Khan Academy in learning the stuff first. Then, you would his Prof. Petrov's lecture a lot more rewarding and interesting.\nHis lectures are hard to follow for another reason — he raps a lot. What I mean is that he writes and calculates really, really fast in live time as he does not prepare lecture slides. The lack of lecture slides also means a lack of truly visualizing many of the 3D surfaces, so I really recommend seeing some Khan Academy videos early on to get a sense of the 3D objects that you will be dealing with. It is very satisfying to see his hand glide across the board like a figure skater, although you may not follow his calculations half the time. Moreover, he asks students to ask questions a lot of the time, but most of the time we cannot process what he taught us: he ends up thinking maybe that we understand the concept perfectly when in reality do not understand anything so we cannot ask anything.\nBeing in the A-School, I took Calculus 3 mostly for fun because I honestly found AP Calc BC incredible. Prof. Petrov's tests are incredibly fair because he almost only tests question types that you have definitely encountered before if you have done all the homework. Also, he has one-question quizzes in most weeks, and they are usually very basic, just a way to check for understand. In the two midterms, a very large proportion of people got 100. I always make small mistakes, so he graded harsher for any smaller mistakes made since too many people got full marks. I only went to his office hour once — and that is two hours before the final. He is relatively patient in explaining concepts; his temper will never grow foul, but his speed of explaination is usually really fast, like his lectures.\nThe biggest weakness in this class is when you get to the hard stuff at the end of the semester: line and surface integrals. In fact, those are the things Prof. Petrov uses the most in his research, but perhaps because of this fact, he teaches these concepts the worst. His thinking of these concepts are too advanced for students. In those lectures for especially Stoke's Theorem and Surface Integrals, he glosses over the concepts pretty fast despite them being very confusing. I got 6/10 for the Stoke's Theorem quiz but eventually understood the concept before the final. All-in-all, I did enjoy calc 3 with Prof. Petrov. He probably won't teach this class anytime soon, but here is my recommendation for the class."

The professor is really nice and friendly. He won't be the reason why you hate the course. His personality (sometimes) makes up for the way he teaches. If you are the type of person who learns best from quick lectures, then this class is for you. I found myself learning more from doing the homework than from the lectures because it was hard for me to retain all the information so quickly. Maybe it would have been easier to review after each lecture. He is also really understanding when you email him. He often extends deadlines or releases information when asked by a lot of students with good reasoning.The work will make you hate the course. The amount of work is a lot though if you leave the WebAssign homework till the end of the week. But they are really useful for learning. There are quizzes based on the assignments and textbook, so it was useful to review those beforehand. The exams, however, get progressively harder through the year. But that's because the topics become more complicated.My TA, Micheal O Cobhthaigh, during the discussions, was pretty intimidating to approach. He knows a lot, but it was hard to keep up when he explained. We also struggled to get his attention half the time whenever we needed help because a lot of other groups needed help as well.I felt like the course would have definitely been better if there had been more chances for the concepts to be explained. But that could have also been solved by going to more office hours. Also, don't leave studying for the final until the night before. This is not the course for that."

The first two exams were fine, but the final exam (though it wasn't cumulative) was impossible and so hard because Prof Tsai hadn't gone that deep into the unit or done the harder examples bc we were short on time.

Professor Tsai was extremely patient with his students, where he would pause every now and then in the middle of his lectures to ask if everyone understood the concept being taught or if anyone had any questions regarding the content. The homework was not too terrible, it was standard CENGAGE homework based on the notes taught in class (however there were times when there would be 50+ questions, but he would sometimes extend the deadline and the midterms were modeled after the homework and notes). The weekly quizzes were the only thing that impacted my grade but that was at fault of our TA, who used his personal textbook from 1960. Overall, I'd suggest forming study groups to excel in the class."

You will have a Webassign, 3 page written homework, and a quiz every Thursday. The written homework and Webassign are not bad and are good practice for the quizzes. The average grade for the quizzes in the class was roughly 75%, the average grade on the first midterm was 70%, the average grade on the second midterm was 75%. I got 85% on quizzes, 83% Midterm 1, 84% Midterm 2, and a 71% on the final (don't know class average on final). THE CLASS WAS NOT CURVED UNLIKE EVERY OTHER MATH 2310 CLASS. Our lowest written homework and quiz were dropped, but thats all. This means the average grade for the class, at least to my knowledge was a C.

Especially when compared to the average math professor at UVA, he does not bog his lectures down with proofs, has great handwriting, and writes everything out in a clear and concise way that translates very well into notes. He is also very kind, and will work to make sure you understand the material. It's also obvious that he is very passionate about Math, and oftentimes that passion is infectious in his lectures. However, his exams and written HWs are very challenging. Be sure to start the Written HW early and make friends in your class, as you'll definitely want to go over your answers (Wolfram Alpha is useful for checking work, but not if you fundamentally misunderstand the problem). You will also want to make sure you know all theorems from lecture and how to apply them to any problem, as you will likely see a new application of said theorems on the exam. While his exams are very challenging, and I often did not get the grade I would've hoped, I'm glad I took the course with Bill. This class made me a much better problem solver and studier, and I learned to think much more like a mathematician throughout the semester. If you don't care to really understand the math and are just taking this course for a pre-req, you're probably better off not taking the course with Bill. Otherwise I highly recommend him."

This is one of the more difficult classes I have taken at UVA, and recommend trying to find a tutor at the beginning of the semester so you don't fall behind. Some of the other students in my class seemed to understand more, but they have mentioned taking similar courses in high school. I had no background in the Calc 3 material, so I felt a lot more behind than the rest of the class.

He will guide you, especially with the written homework. His lectures focus a lot on general introductions and then in-depth examples. Where you will probably gain the most understanding through the homework. That's why I'd recommend spreading out practice and review throughout the week: try not to cram it all at once, or else you won't remember it adequately. Learning math takes a lot of practice and review. In fact, that's why cramming is probably the absolute worst thing you could do in this class. Especially since the theorems covered in Calculus III can be quite complex (ahem, Stokes Theorem particularly), you will have a horrible time if you don't make efforts to 1) attend office hours for help and 2) practice, practice, and practice over time to get a thorough understanding of the material.\nAs a side note: the lectures cover an alternate approach to Stokes Theorem that involve differential equations. This is different from the vector approach taken in the textbook. However, it is helpful to know both methods for the final exam (although you are free to use whichever method you prefer). So, make sure you are keeping up with the textbook reading throughout the semester. It is helpful to have read the textbook before the lectures, so that you come in with a basic understanding of what will be discussed.\nProfessor Mark is a very supportive instructor. If you are struggling with something or feel that the disparity between the lectures and textbook material is too great, reach out to him. He'll give you what you need in terms of extra material or reading. Hope that helps!"

The homework is often guided by example videos and take around 5 hrs/week: not too bad. The presentations are similar in difficulty and are often explained in office hours, which you should attend. The real challenge are the tests which are much more conceptual and have a low relative average (good curves, final averaged a 51%). Solid preparation with the textbook for several hours for a couple days did the trick. Understanding how to run through integrals without understanding the 3D geometry is what will do you in. Focus less on the arithmetic, more on what is happening with vectors and space. Biased review as I got an A+, but there were a couple A, A-, and a good number of B+ I think."

We also did three recorded group presentations which were kinda a pain to do but were graded on completion. Gennady clearly cares about his students and wants them to succeed, but doesn't hold back when it comes to assigned lots of difficult work. Some of his lectures were good, some you had no clue what was going on. TA Jun had potential but was often way underprepared when it came to answering homework questions.

I don't know anyone in my class so maybe that'd make it better. Gennady is definitely passionate about his work, but he's all over the place. It's very hard to follow along when you are taking notes, particularly on paper. Sometimes you'll understand, blink twice, and then he seems to be talking about something completely different, so you scramble to catch up, get confused, and then you find out it was a proof that you'll never see or use again in your life.\nGrades are comprised of 50% HW, 35% on midterms and finals, and 15% on other such as presentations.\nMidterms are okay ( the average on the first was 73% ), and I am yet to see how he grades presentations.\nBut the homework...Every week there is a WebAssign and written homework due on Tuesday. The WebAssign is definitely doable although it may take a lot of time and effort, but, you will finish it. The written homework is where the difficulty in this class is. The written homework is impossible, he takes easy concepts and makes them as difficult as humanely possible by making sure you have to use the most obscure formulas that you learned about for one day in middle school in order to solve them. I had a personal, professional tutor for this class, and they ended up quitting because it was too hard! You have to go to office hours to get the homework done, and what's the point of that? To just be given the answers? I mean ill take them but homework should not be hard enough that you don't even put it an effort.\nIn summary, don't even think about taking this class unless you have to. And if you do, good luck."

Don't get it wrong, the class is HARD. In fact, despite being a CS major i spent more time on this class than my cs class. The class is mostly hard because of the homeworks. Homework is broken down into webassigns and written homeworks. Webassigns are just guaranteed 100%'s, as you get infinite tries on the questions. The hard part comes with the written homeworks. They're quite hard and require a lot of deep understanding and complex thought to complete, and i can almost guarantee you that you won't be able to finish one completely without going to office hours. that being said, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Ultimately, the reason i succeeded in the class was because i went to Gennady's office hours and the TA's office hours. This class is definitely a more-you-put-in-the-better-you-do-esque class - at a certain point, the more time you put in i think it almost directly correlates to your performance.On another note, Gennady is amazing and is incredibly hardworking. He's almost singlehandedly responding to all questions on Piazza and goes above and beyond to ensure that students are learning. He offers tons of resources, and the grading is generally leanient, as he drops something like 2 of the worst webassigns and written homeworks, and generally curves the exams. I'd recommend taking this class if you're interested in math, need to get this as a pre-req, or are looking to stretch your scope in math a little and be challenged while doing so."

Her lecture is very structured and she will review concepts from calc 1 and 2 to refresh your memory and tie them to the lesson that day. She really wants to make sure her students understand the material. She assigned 3 assignments on webassign per week and would even give a 10% bonus if you submitted it 24 hours before the deadline, which was not difficult to do. The webassigns were pretty much what we learned in class and provided a lot more types of problems to give more practice. I find the homework in this class very effective, not too time-consuming, and I would not consider it \"busy work\". As the semester progressed, some of the homeworks, especially towards the end, were more difficult and longer, but they still offered a lot of practice which helped with the more difficult content. Every couple of weeks we would have written homeworks that gave you a good idea of what the exam problems would look like. Her exams are very fair. If you understand the material in class and understand the homeworks, you will probably get a good grade on the exam. After the second exam, the material gets pretty difficult and confusing, but Professor Ure explains it really well and will also spend time explaining it in office hours if you need it. Even if her explanations aren't helping, the textbook is pretty good and gives good explanations and practice problems. There was a discussion portion of the class, but it wasn't really that helpful because the teacher mainly rushed through the topics and made a lot of algebraic mistakes in his work so it made it really difficult to follow. I still went because there were practice problems, but you don't really need to go, a lot of times I feel like I was wasting my time there when I could have been doing work for another class."

On a lot of questions he would take off points if you didn't show simple steps, but his exams were so long that writing out those steps would waste too much time.

The written homework was graded a little harshly sometimes but other than that just be ready to work a little harder than for some of the other professors."

He left for a week of lectures and then on the following quiz took of points when I did things a different way than he did them, even though that is how I was taught to do it by another professor.

Let me tell you... this is the first math class I've taken that has truly challenged me. However, do NOT shy away from this class. The first two weeks were stressful, but trying to visualize math in three dimensions takes time; admittedly, I almost tried to move down to calc 1320 the first week because I was so stressed. My advisor (who was run the math department) told me to give it a week before I made any decisions. I'm so glad I stayed in the class, because it has been so foundational. The first midterm's average was a 69, but honestly it wasn't that hard-- a lot of kids in my class didnt come to lecture or actually review. As someone who was horrible at visualizing/ graphing functions in R3, I got a 95 on both midterms just by reviewing all his notes frequently and doing tremendous amounts of practice problems. The only way to do well in this class is to sit down and grind out a bunch of problems from the textbook (which is where Prasit gets all his in class examples from). Overall, not a really difficult class if you're willing to put in the effort; those who didn't certainly didnt do well."

Even though he doesn’t take attendance, you should go to every class, because it is fast-paced (on average, we learn two sections in the book per day). You get homework problems from the textbook that you have to submit every week, and he also gives you worksheet problems, which you don’t submit but are assigned so that you can practice learning the necessary concepts. However, I didn’t like the homework and textbook problems because they were unnecessarily nasty and required too much algebraic/numeric computation. But you still should do them because they help you learn the underlying concepts.\nEven though Prasit is good at lecturing, he’s not really that great at explaining individual math problems (e.g. if you’re struggling to do a particular problem). That’s why I found it kind of awkward to go to his office hours, and he’s really not that approachable and sociable as a person. So if you’re not that great at math and if you struggle a lot, Prasit is probably not the best teacher. However, if you want to take the class, try to get Matt McCarthy as your TA. He’s really good and explains the concepts well during discussions.\nOther than that, Prasit is a pretty funny and quirky guy. He always wears these colored socks to class every day. One day he biked to class, and came in with some type of bike/athletic clothes."

The homework questions were unnecessarily long and you would have to spend hours just doing the calculations. As for the final, it was also ridiculous in that there were a gazillion typos. Also, office hours just weren't helpful because everyone was there and he doesn't tend to explain problems well.  He's not approachable and kind of scary, not gonna lie."

This prof is cool (climbing through windows and making math jokes), but as far as instructors go, he is not the most effective and often fails to adequately answer questions. He often dismisses material as being \"intuitive\" and doesn't go into depth with it as a result, which can make lectures confusing. The lectures themselves consist of Dr. Bhattacharya simply reviewing an outline he made of the textbook without any additional insight or other problems for explanation. Homework consisted of ten practice problems for the week, which were often extremely easy and did not particularly help as practice. The worksheet problems were similarly useless as it was unlikely that much of the material from those problems would make it into the exams.Overall, I'm very disappointed in this class because Calc 3 has some incredibly interesting topics to teach, but Dr. Bhattacharya manages to make it boring and painful, and often presents it as trivial. I would recommend taking this course with a different professor or maybe at community college instead to find a better teacher. Dr. Bhattacharya may be a genius, but it seems like he has difficulty explaining concepts at a level that undergraduates can understand.The one consistent good about the course was the grad TA, Matt McCarthy. He was an excellent TA and explained things really well. It was unfortunate that his office hours overlapped with the class lecture, but I wish he would have taken that opportunity to just go to lecture with us and help out explaining things. I really wish he had been our prof because I believe I would have been better able to understand the material if he was given more time to explain it to us.All that being said, it is very easy to do well in this class because of the grade inflation, but don't expect to get the most out of it."

However, if I stared at the problems, textbooks, and notes long enough, I eventually understood the material and what Prasit was talking about. Also, don't be dumb like me and not do the optional  worksheet problems; those help a lot in terms of understanding what you go over in lecture. All in all, if you're motivated enough to take the time outside of class to learn and understand the material thoroughly, Prasit is for you."

Overall, I loved the material, and Xiang was a decent teacher. It would've been nice if we'd spent more time on vector calculus -- the material isn't too bad most of the semester, but everyone agrees that the last few weeks of the class (where we learn vector calc) were the hardest."

Also, sometimes when I went to office hours for a topic I didn't understand he would look at me confused and would just continue to confuse me.

You're probably taking this because it's a requirement and professor Farhat is a really good choice for it. I thought she was a really great lecturer and was clear about concepts. I always felt I could learn by simply going to class and while I would read over the book too, it wasn't necessary. She covers a lot of material and writes difficult exams that really test your knowledge, but she is fair in grading and the process makes you really understand what you covered.  I've had her for 2 classes and her style is to not collect/grade HW, but rather each class there is a 5-10 minute quiz on the last HW material which you can do fine on if you did the assigned problems."

Concepts build on concepts of Calc 2, so remember your trig functions and how to derive and integrate. The first two exams weren't bad if you studied (I did chapter review problems in the book, redid webworks and made a study sheet to remember formulas). The homework are a little long because there are 5-7 book problems with about 18 webworks problems. It doesn't seem like much but it takes a while.Discussion is a joke-don't go. It's a 5-5:50 class so it took a lot for me to get out after having finished my classes for so long, and I regretted it every time. The TA was awful and the discussion didn't coincide with how the concepts were taught in class.\nProfessor Obus is literally amazing. He explains everything in a way that makes it so understandable. He writes everything down on the board so you don't miss anything-I've gone to every class and I don't regret it at all. He's sort of a goofball but he's probably the smartest person you'll ever meet. If you look at his CV it's literally 5 pages wrong. His teaching is impeccable-he can answer all of your questions because he not only understands everything he's talking about he goes above and beyond to make are you understand everything. His lectures are very well organized because he has a composition notebook (lol I haven't even touched one since elementary school) of his plans for the lectures which he does previous to every class.If you don't have to take this class for your major or you're not math oriented I wouldn't take this class, but if you do take it with Andrew. He also teaches upper level math courses so look for him cause he's probably the best professor I've had so far tied with Dave Kittlesen."

Her homework assignments were helpful and actually reinforced the material well rather than making me do hours of bullshit.

She is also one of the fairest testers I have ever had (and from talking to friends with other teachers, she is undoubtedly the fairest Calc lll teacher).

Homework was never too bad, weekly quizzes were fair, the exams were pretty hard, and so was the final. But there's a HUGE curve (I think I had a mid 80s average at the end of the class and it was curved to an A), and simply having Michael Hill as a professor makes it worth it. He's funny, engaging, uses colored chalk (super helpful for this material), has legible handwriting (unlike some math professors...), and is very helpful in office hours. If you need to take MATH 2310 for whatever reason, take it with Hill -- you won't regret it."

I would spend so much time with classmates or myself trying to figure out what he wanted on written homework, especially since a lot of grading seemed to be arbitrary. Midterms and the final were impossible. The curve on our midterms was so bad that a 55/80 became a B...Basically take it from a different teacher unless you took Calc 3 before, and even then I knew people who were still struggling with material they'd already learned."

We started with some number theory and then went to relations and functions, which is the meat of the class, and then to cardinality to round it out. The majority of the time was spent on functions, such as establishing bijections and knowing what that means, and I still feel like more time could have been spent on it, especially for how crucial being comfortable with functions and bijections is. For being touted as a great class for learning how to proof, we did not have any actual explicit lessons on proofing besides learning what Proof by Induction was (which did give me a leg up in Survey of Algebra), we just mostly learned by seeing the examples in class and doing his homeworks, which were an utter pain. He would assign 8 homework questions a week, most of which took a decent amount of time, and would only have half of them graded. He himself is the most organized lecturer I have ever had (numbering every theorem, lemma, postulate, and example that he did), which is extremely nice and helpful when referring to notes. He is also, however, one of the driest lecturers I have ever had in my life, which doesn't add to the enjoyablility of the class. Taking this class helped get me familiar with what tools were needed to succeed in higher level proofing classes, but not how to effectively USE said tools, if that makes sense. I took it, I am glad I took it to get me prepared for Survey and Real (and the fact that it counts as a Math Major elective), but I did not enjoy the class one bit."

He stands back to the class and meticulously goes through the entire curriculum, numbering every little theorem, lemma, and example he gives. As a result, it's incredibly easy to follow along and studying is super easy, because he posts his tidy notes online if your notes are a mess, as mine were. However, class lecture was incredibly boring. Abramenko would occasionally turn around and ask \"any questions?\", but that was about the extent of his engagement with us during class. When answering questions, he was helpful, but if he didn't like a question, he would make it known that it was a stupid question. The class material was very interesting and was a very good basis for studying further mathematics, but Abramenko's lecture style really detracts from the learning experience. Discussion and TA office hours are where most of the learning actually happens, and our TA Darien was very helpful, and eager to help with the weekly problem sets, which were challenging and time-consuming. Even though the homework was rather difficult, the exams were written very fairly (far less difficult than problem sets) and Abramenko made it possible to get an A. Would recommend this class if you're fine listening to a robot for a semester."

The course material is extremely boring but it is a good introduction to the material that is taught in Survey of Algebra and Basic Real Analysis. This course itself is structured in a way that it is difficult to get an A. Exams are 60% of your grade, homework 25% and quizzes 10% with a 5% buffer that will be added to your highest exam. Essentially you need to do well on the exams to get an A. The exams itself are not terribly hard, but if you mess up a small thing, you can lose a lot of points. The quizzes are actually pretty hard. They start easy but as you work your way through the semester, the difficulty rises a lot. The homeworks are decent in my opinion. They take a lot of time, but you should average a 95+ on them.  Lastly, Professor Abramenko is a robot. Try and take it with another professor if you can. His notes are very precise, almost a copy from the textbook. However, he is not the best at teaching. He just writes exactly from his notes and that's it. Overall, I did not enjoy this course, but it will help me when I take higher math courses, hence the name, Transition to Higher Mathematics."

The thing is, she NEVER gave us answer keys or solutions to any of the class activities or quizzes. We'd have to go to office hours to get help, and even then, her curt and condescending attitude would discourage me and others from even attending. I got most of my help from the TA, who was AMAZING. I don't want to ramble further, but her consistent slack in giving us information about our final project and just in general was horrible. She let herself have over 3 months to plan a final project whereas we had to continuously use \"tokens\" to make up for actual work. While I got an A in the class, the way Dr. Bergner handled this class was just terrible, and she needs to make a change and actually invest in her students and teach."

This said, the class was super worth it to take. I felt like I learned a lot and it really does a good job achieving its goal: acting as a transition to higher mathematics. You won't regret taking it with Ono, I think.It's important to know that the tests are MUCH easier than you think they are going to be after the lectures; especially in the early lectures, he very quickly starts talking about pretty advanced stuff. Just try to keep up generally understanding the things he talks about, and make sure you memorize everything he asks you to, and you'll do great on the test."

            "text": "Seriously would advise against taking this class if you want experience proof-writing. Ken Ono is a fine professor; he's pretty solid at explaining things, but the structure of his course is pretty terrible. Math 3000 is supposed to introduce you to basic math logic and intro to proof writing, but Ken Ono focuses a majority of the class on random proofs from number theory. Out of the 6 or 7 units we cover in the class, only two relate to the curriculum of the class - the rest survey elementary number theory and complex arithmetic. I took Basic Real concurrently with this course and learned how to write proofs 3 weeks into the course, so by the time we even got to math logic in this course, it wasn't even useful to me. I doubt that anyone in that class who didn't have outside experience with proof-writing really came out of that class knowing how to write a formal proof well.\nThis all would've been okay if we at least learned the other material well. For the homeworks, he assigns problems to people to present during discussion. When assigned a problem, you have to go to office hours for him to give you the solution to the answer. So basically there is no reason to do the homework on your own as you will be fed the answer directly from him in OH or indirectly from a classmate in discussion. While this certainly made homeworks easy, this is not the best method for practicing the material. The exams are also useless because a majority of the questions are straight memorization. The short answer questions in particular are useless because many of them just have you recite the proof of some isolated, long-winded number theory theorem he covered in class. This makes the exams really easy as well if you just put in the effort to memorize the notes, but that's kind of useless for learning.\nAs a person, Ken Ono is highly egotistical. A lot of people like him because he comes off as that cool, fascinating math professor, but his lecture style comes off as show-offy. He seems to care more about coming off as intelligent by displaying knowledge of the material he's supposed to be teaching us rather than facilitating actual understanding.\nI'd say if you're taking this course to prepare you for Basic Real or Survey of Algebra, this will not help at all. It will just be a relatively easy class with an annoying professor. If you don't really care about learning anything and you want an easy A, then this is a good course.\nIf you're debating whether you should take Math 3000 at all or just go directly into Basic or Survey, I would look at the professors for all 3 classes. I've heard good things about other Math 3000 professors, so Ono's class is likely not representative of the course in general. On the other hand, I also know some professors spend a good amount of time at the beginning of Basic and Survey to introduce students to proof writing while others just kind of jump right in. In my personal experience, Thomas Mark (Basic Real), Evangelia Gazaki (Basic Real, Advanced Linear), and Craig Huneke (Intro to Abstract Algebra), are all great professors to have for your first proof based course, so if either of them are teaching I don't think it is necessary to take Math 3000."

            "text": "Dr. Gromoll is an exceptional lecturer - arguably the best I've experienced when it comes to logically and clearly breaking down complex mathematical concepts. His passion for probability is contagious, and his enthusiasm genuinely resonates with students.\nHowever, beyond his engaging lectures, nearly every other aspect of his probability course can be quite frustrating. By far, he is the most disorganized professor I've had. He frequently arrived late to class, lost track of important course materials and priorities, and even once forgot to print enough copies of a midterm exam (causing about a third of the class to take it a week later). The combination of his dynamic teaching style and his chronic disorganization made for an interesting, if somewhat stressful, semester.\nIn terms of logistics and grading, here's how the course breaks down:\nPre-class assignments: 5%\nHomework: 15%\nTwo midterm exams: 25% each\nCumulative final exam: 30%\nThere is also a slight opportunity for extra credit through active participation in the discussion forum, but nobody seemed to take advantage of this.\nFor roughly half of the lectures, there are pre-class videos by Professor Melcher, who is also an excellent lecturer, followed by a short MCQ quiz. Weekly homework sets typically include about 8 to 14 problems.\nRegarding exam difficulty and grading: exam averages generally ranged from about 50% at their lowest to around 60% at their highest. Typically, only about 10 to 20% of students achieved scores above 80%. The exam histograms provided by Dr. Gromoll grouped results broadly (0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, and 80-100%) so it's hard to say what % of students were scoring 90 or highe. Given that exams constituted 80% of the overall grade, with minimal benefits from extra credit, many students understandably felt concerned. Dr. Gromoll mentioned some end-of-semester grade adjustments, though it was unclear what exactly that would entail.\nPersonally, I ended up with an 83% raw score that resulted in an A-, and I suspect I was close to the cutoff for an A, perhaps around 85-86%. Without a detailed grade distribution, it's hard to say exactly, but grading appeared quite harsh overall. There's no way he applied a proportional 7-point curve uniformly across the class - far too many students would have failed. Considering my own roughly 7-point adjustment and the fact that I was on the high end of the distribution for each exam, I imagine some students received significantly more generous curves. I might be making a leap here, but if the average student's exam scores were around 55%, perhaps he curved those students by 14-15 points to bring the class average to around a C+. If that's the case, this is easily the toughest probability course the math department offers. Dr. Gromoll probably awarded only 3-4 A's in a class of about 30 students, noticeably fewer than other probability professors. Further, the practice exams written by Melcher felt substantially easier than those administered by Gromoll.\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend Dr. Gromoll if grading is a primary concern. It would be interesting to see the official grade distribution and how significantly he adjusted grades to avoid widespread failures. The only scenario where taking Dr. Gromoll's class makes sense is if you're extremely confident in your mathematical abilities and genuinely want to learn deeply. In that case, his amazing lecturing abilities should serve you well."

            "text": "The course is pretty tough and will take up a good amount of time. Gromoll has interesting lectures and does seem to explain pretty well, however, the class does feel disorganized. I'm not sure but I don't think the slides are his own, so they can sometimes be confusing as he is trying to interpret them for you. The way the class is paced often ends up making the class feel rushed. I believe if there was a better pacing on topics that are more complicated, the course would benefit greatly. The problem sets can be difficult and will take a while. The textbook feels a bit odd at times where the examples feel too simple or explained in a confusing way making the problem sets more difficult. The material starts really with basics of probability (counting) then moving to random variables, and ending with distributions with joint variables distributions. I would say if you do not feel like you can handle or fit in the amount of work please be warned it doesn't get easier. Like most math courses the material is highly cumulative, any holes will accumulate. He's not generous on grading, but it is moderately fair. The tests consists of multiple choice and free response, so no partial credit on multiple choice. The grading scale can also be in the up in the air and a little bit of guesswork, since it is very dependent on how the rest of the class performs. As the other review states, if your concerned about your grade, potentially consider waiting for another semester."

He is prepared for questions, occasionally goofs up on board calculations, but more than makes up for it with his relentless engagement with the students. We are constantly and rightfully questioned and tested, though not cold called or anything.His use of metaphor is intrepid for a math class, often relating the concepts--even the examples--to flora, fauna, and extranea from his grad school days.Tests were fair. He clearly knows how to differentiate students. Textbook was boring, but clear when needed, as was often needed when doing homework and studying."

That final just did not feel like the midterms or the hw. You've gotta know your stuff, so repping practice problems is your best bet to study. I think it's difficult to end this class with lower than a B though, so take that as you will.\nThe professor deserves his own paragraph. He's so kind and sweet, but sometimes he gets a little... frazzled? He's definitely unique in his own way. Not a bad professor, not the greatest either. Just write down everything he writes on the board because some seemingly random/'useless' computation he does in class may just be the answer to something in hw or exam."

The Central Limit Theorem (probably the coolest thing in probability) is only mentioned in one sentence in class notes.\nOh man, the lectures are incredibly slow and boring. When doing examples in class, Dimou solves the ENTIRE problem, not just the part where we need to apply some prob concept. This results in about 60% of the lectures being  Dimou working on simplifying highschool algebra problems or Dimou solving double integrals. This made lectures painstakingly slow. Homeworks are pretty difficult, but not impossible. They usually go beyond class material in some critical ways, which meant I wasn't able to solve some of them without seeing some \"trick\" we never covered in class... Exams are really easy if you do the practice problems he sends out before each exam. I was looking forward to taking prob, but I felt around half of this class was not very important, applicable, or interesting."

Professor Petrov is a really good professor - he genuinely cares about his students and about the material, and teaches it pretty well. That said, his recorded lectures can sometimes be a bit scattered and I ended up not watching them and just reviewing his lecture notes and doing the problem sets.\nThe breakdown of the class is 15% participation - go to class, participate in Slack, plus pop quizzes on recent material that are not terribly hard but not the most fun - avgs were around 5-6/10 and they're not too big of a deal, staying up on lectures will help; also they're surprise quizzes so come to class b/c they can't be made up and he only dropped 1.5 of them this semester out of 7. I got 10/10 on most of them by staying up to date. It's 30% problem sets (100% if you do them and get the right answers and there's a solution manual online to confirm your answers - he doesn't grade them harshly at all, but they're solid for learning the content), 15% for each of two midterms (in-class, usually about 3 problems - more about his tests later), and 25% for the final. We also have a flipped classroom which I didn't mind because we did problem set problems in class and usually finished 60% of it during the week, so finishing them each week outside of class was not too bad. I used the textbook for the first couple of weeks but then gave up and didn't actually end up needing it the rest of the semester.\nFor his tests - he posts a bunch of practice midterm/final problems, and we got a cheat sheet (one page front and back) to make ourselves for each exam. Do the problems, understand them, clarify any questions and office hours, and you'll be fine. The first midterm threw me for a bit of a loop but I had no real issue getting 90+% on the midterms/final. It's all about doing a bunch of practice.\nAll in all, not too difficult of a class, pretty fun tbh and Petrov is great. Don't take him too seriously b/c he can be a bit blunt in class/OH but he genuinely cares about your learning and works hard to make sure you understand the content and feel prepared for the exam. Highly recommend this class with him!\n#tCFSpring2022"

Professor Petrov does care about his students -- we had Slack channels and he responded very quickly to questions -- but he can also be kind of blunt and not the most approachable. The class was taught flipped classroom styled -- recorded lectures and then in-class problem set work. However, I (and it seemed like other around me) were often lost during the lectures and didn't have much of any idea of how to start with the problems. Thankfully, the homework was primarily just submitting answers to the in-class problem sets so (pro: homework load was light, con: sometimes meant I was just copying answers and not actually learning). I did find the exams to be easier than the class problems which made the class manageable. I'm not a math major but I think it would've been more enjoyable if I was."

You learn the basics from the lecture class and from the worksheet you collaborate with classmates + him to learn other techniques; you learn the most from worksheet classes and while they're technically optional you should attend them. The most difficult part of the classes tend to be understanding the calculus (integrals and infinite sums.) Multivariable calc is not needed; the only concept you use are double integrals which he teaches well. Try talking to him both during class (especially during worksheet sessions) and office hours. Like most math classes, grade is about 75% exam, 25% other stuff. You get a cheat sheet for exams but that's purely so you don't have to memorize formulas; you need to understand the concepts to do well on exams.\n#tCFF23"

Yes, she is nice, very approachable, and will explain things when asked, but she is not a clear professor. I took this class in Spring of 2017, and the fact that she hasn't taught this class was extremely evident. The second midterm average was a 48, and she was evidently angry at the class, having not had an average that low in a decade (well duh, since she hasn't taught the class in 7 years). I'm trying to get a C in this course, and I have never had trouble with math before. I took the practice test for both the APMA class and another professor and got between 90s and 100s, only to receive the lowest grade in my life on her exams. Going to class is a must, to get the weird in class examples she presents, and going to office hours so she can see your face is good, but other than that, it's a waste of time because she shows you the hardest way to solve simple problems and then presents complex, weirdly phrased questions on the test that have no relation to previous material. The only way to succeed in this course is to be Tai Melcher herself. One plus - she allows cheat sheets. But here's the catch: they're useless. Not once did I look down at my cheat sheet during the test. So, if you want a teacher who is unclear, is angry when students don't succeed, and will knock down your GPA and destroy your love and confidence in math, I would highly recommend this course. I am a statistics major, and plan to take any additional math classes I need in the E-school, but everything is straight forward, fair, and easier. The college needs to reevaluate their professors - and I'm sure the math department will after they see Melcher's course evals and the class average."

The homework was very easy as the answers to all the odd questions were in the back of the book, so you knew right away if you did a problem wrong. The exams were even easier as Grujic told us ahead of time what specific topic each of the problems on the test was going to be on and then provided us with practice problems from the book on each topic to guide our studying. We weren't required to know anything besides these topics that he listed, so studying was a breeze. We also didn't need to know any proofs, which made it even easier. That being said, it made paying attention in class very hard (which wasn't really important since it was possible to get an A+ without paying attention). The content itself was very easy, and having taken AP Stat in high school made it even easier. I think the class average ended up being above a 90; not sure if he wound up curving down but he didn't sound like he planned on it. Overall, one of the easiest As I've ever gotten at UVa, but not a worthwhile course in terms of actually learning much."

He curves every exam ridiculously hard (by this I mean that when I went to go check my answers for the second midterm, about half of them were wrong and I still got a 97 on the exam) so that everyone can do well enough, and there's only ever one challenging problem on the test. Literally everything else was stuff we covered in class, which made it really easy to do because this semester's exams were open note. I know I did just say that I got like half of the questions on the exam wrong, but part of that is because I'm very very bad at calculus; almost all of those mistakes were basic arithmetic problems. In terms of his teaching, he basically does what's in the textbook. I didn't actually read the textbook, but when I went to go to the problem sets that he assigned, I noticed that pretty much every example he gives in the class comes straight out of the textbook examples and the same with the proofs. He goes on a couple of philosophical tangents about universality, probabilistic vs. deterministic truths, intuition vs. rigorous proofs, and I won't lie, it made it want to become a scholar in probability theory and its implications for the philosophy of math. He's also relatively accommodating for assignments and their deadlines. There were times when he would give us two or three extensions on a homework assignment because we were all just so overwhelmed or we had an exam for the class very close to the homework due date. At the beginning of the semester, he had also intended to give us pop quizzes, but when he found out that a very large portion of the class was international students 12 hours away, he decided not to. The grading distribution was 10% quizzes (he did give us 2 multiple choice, really easy quizzes to do at home just to have something to put in this category), 20% homework (6 problem sets, each about 10-15 pages typed for me when solved), 20% Exam 1, 20% Exam 2, 30% Final."

If you do and end up with Axel, it isn't the end of the world, just don't get behind and try to find some help from outside sources."

Axel is very smart and surprisingly funny and although I liked him as a person, he didn't do a great job of explaining difficult concepts.  Axel  loved to solve proofs during class and there were times when he would solve a proof for some 20 minutes before telling everyone frantically copying down what he wrote that we didn't actually have to know it for the test.  About a third of your grade is made up of homeworks as well as \"pop\" quizzes which he often told us about ahead of time towards the end of the semester.  The exams were pretty difficult with averages in the 70's but one benefit to having Axel is that he is very generous when it comes to giving partial credit.  Additionally, the class was curved very generously and despite having performed average on the exams I got an A-.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this class but if you are a math/stat major you likely have no choice."

But if you arent a person who is really proactive about studying, it is easy to shoot yourself in the foot with this class. The mathmatica tests are ridiculous (each one has 9 or 10 questions, no partial credit) and of you wait until the last part of the semester to take all the tests, you will be seriously sorry.

His lectures generally explain where concepts come from while the homework and tests require that you apply those concepts. The material in this course, as I said before, is extremely difficult. Axel makes the class very doable in a couple of ways, however. The quizzes are essentially completion, the homework and quizzes count for a good chunk of the grade (homeworks are not particularly long) and the exams are graded with a lot of partial credit. I came out of the first exam feeling terrible about it and ended up being very happy with my grade. Finally, one more tip for doing well in the class: if you do/understand every single problem he assigns for homework, rather than just the minimum 4 problems required for each homework, you will be well prepared for the tests as much of the exam material is very similar to homework problems. Overall, I really liked Axel, enjoyed this class, and came out with a grade I was happy with despite the challenging material."

            "text": "Where to start. Well, first off, Axel is a great guy. He's extremely smart, but also chill if you need to ask him a question or approach him after class to reinforce a topic. He was available during office hours and really helped you if you were struggling. However, lectures were kind of bizarre. He kind of had this matra that formulas were complicated/ useless and tried to make us understand probability from a proof/ intuitive sort of manor. Sometimes we would do a proof for a simple formula for half the class, which just really confused most of us. The textbook also wasn't very illuminating (it seemed to make the \"intuitive\" concepts Axel would introduce increasingly complex). Homework was very hard, however, easier than exams so I guess I see the intuition behind that (also them being 30% of your grade is a lifesaver). However, the most redeeming quality about Axel is his partial credit policy on exams. As a first year, taking this class was certainly extremely intimidating and challenging (I had flown through calc 3 quite easily and this class really confused me). But, even though exams were tough, Axel gave so much partial credit. LIke if you just tried to write a formula down and had some sort of answer, you would get 7/10 points even if you were completely wrong. For the final I came out of it basically crying (hardest exam I think I've ever taken and he let us bring in a cheat sheet) and ended up with a 91% (definitely due to his partial credit lol). From what I've gathered, probability is just a hard class period. Axel was a pretty good professor (he's quite young though so I can't really blame him), and he tried to make hard concepts make sense and released practice midterms and finals which were helpful. I would recommend using the book to get the big picture before lecture, and focusing on what he emphasizes. There was always one proof question on the exams, but you just had to memorize all the ones he would write down during class.  Don't take this class if you don't have to (unless you just really have a passion for probability) but if you do, from what I've heard, Axel is your best bet."

She'll usually make snide remarks that sound more at place in the mouth of a gossipy high schooler and normally she disregards the concerns and comments from students. For example, one student requested for a practice exam to be made available (as this would help prepare him for the real exam) and she quickly derided him in front of the class for making a \"horrible suggestion\".\nMost importantly, the curriculum of the class is poorly constructed and not well thought-out. Consider a 'simple' probability question: If there are five numbered baskets (1,2,3,4,5) and five numbered corresponding balls, and you drop a ball at random into each bucket, what is the probability that no ball will be in its correct bucket? The material in the course doesn't even equip students with the means to solve that. Instead most of the course is spent learning about abstract models and symbolism without ever discussing how to apply this to real-world problems.\nIf possible, try to take the course somewhere else and get transfer credit for it.\nP.S.

            "text": "Professor McMillan uses a hybrid structure for his classes: he releases packets of the material to be covered in class that week and that week's hw (typically 4-6 questions, 3 easy and 3 hard, that you have the entire week to do), and lectures on the topics in class. He is very smart, so sometimes I had no idea what he was talking about, but it is easy to follow what he is saying if you have read the material before class.McMillan also uses a generous grading structure; 25% of your grade is based on participation, and the participation grade isn't capped at 100% (capped at 107.5%). The homeworks are difficult, but are graded on your explanation rather than your answer, and if you go to office hours, he will usually tell you the answer expected. The exams are generously curved (usually a square root curve).McMillan's ODE definitely seems to be on the harder end of classes, but it is one of the most rewarding classes I have taken. He encourages you to think and use math as a logical analysis tool rather than a series of steps to follow, so the learning curve is steep, but I came out of the course feeling like I could read math and was exposed to several new ideas. He is also extremely approachable and genuinely wants his students to do well; he sends out a feedback form mid-semester and changes the course structure based on the responses. Definitely recommend if you have the space for a difficult class in your schedule, and are willing to put the work in.\n#tCFS24"

            "text": "Professor McMillan is clearly very intelligent, and made an effort to be a good teacher, but unfortunately was not a good teacher.Every week the professor assigns a 10-15 page packet that you are expected to go through before the lectures of the week. For starters, he generally sent out these packets half a day before our class, which made the expectation of completing them before class highly unfair. However, if you did not go through the entire packet before lecture, you were in trouble - these packets were less a “pre-reading” to prepare you for the content to be taught in class, but rather he seemed to expect us to entirely teach ourselves the content through the packet. This was demonstrated by the fact that he would not reiterate the content in the packets during lectures, and he would expect us to present our answers for questions on the content to the rest of the class (which we also were graded on for accuracy) the same day he introduced the content - essentially we were expected to have already come to class having mastered the content well enough that we could present it to the rest of the class before he even covered it in lecture. As a result, I spent a significant amount of time outside of class attempting to teach myself the content, and my time in class felt absolutely useless since he seemed to barely go over the content.To make matters worse, the packets he assigned were very, very difficult to understand, and so the majority of what I learnt about ODE this semester came from various online sources and youtube videos rather than through the course that I am paying for. I would like to add that this is the general consensus among many of my peers who also took this class, and isn’t simply because I \"lack the comprehension skills.\"The TAs for this class were lovely, but prof McMillan did not give them the answers to any homeworks or assignments, and so often they either could not help with homework questions or gave us the wrong answers (they tried their very bests though). McMillan also gave us some practice questions in class (the questions he expected us to complete on our own and then present in front of the class) but did not ever give us complete solutions for these questions, and so at no point did I know if I was ever solving questions correctly as I had no means of checking my solutions - this was very frustrating when attempting to prepare for the exams.Speaking of the exams, McMillan bragged at one point that the average on his exams were a 40-50%, and I don’t blame him - the exams are tough. They seem to focus very little on actual math and instead seriously emphasise memorisation of definitions and derivations; if you’re looking for a math class that focuses on concepts and proofs then ODE with McMillan is the one for you, but if you’re expecting to do actual math in this class, be prepared to be disappointed.Overall, McMillan was a nice enough guy - although occasionally a little condescending and unapproachable - and seemed to care about the class. Halfway through the semester he did make an effort to adapt the course structure to accommodate our needs better, which I really appreciated. However, I believe there is something fundamentally wrong with his teaching style, and so I still would not recommend taking this class. If you do, prepare to dedicate a very significant amount of time outside of class teaching yourself the content and completing highly challenging homework questions (which you are expected to work with a group to complete, but even with our 5 minds it took many, many, many hours to complete just a few questions)."

            "text": "Before I write this review, I want to give a bit of context. I took Calculus III and ODE with McMillan, so a year of math with him. Both classes followed the same general structure, and the same methods of teaching were applied to both. I say this because if you take a class with him as the instructor, I'd be willing to guess that the same general outline as applied in these previous two classes will be applied.As an instructor, McMillan is great. Yes, he teaches math, but these classes are so much more than JUST math classes. He mentions physics, astronomy, engineering, circuits, economics, chemistry, philosophy - he is aware that not just math majors are taking his classes, and so he introduces concepts from other fields where this type of math can be applied. He puts a lot of emphasis on physical intuition and understanding where certain ideas are coming from. 30-50% of the exam problems you have will easily be about memorization of definitions and theorems, and the other 50-70% will be about actually solving problems, some being very easy and pulled from the homework and packets, others being more challenging derivations and problems.The homework's are time consuming, but you will learn a lot. If you go to his office hours, he is more than willing to walk you through how to solve and understand the problems that he has assigned. Normally half of the problems are easy, and the other half are challenging problems. You are not expected to just do math and circle your answer, he is looking for reasoning and logic. You do the math, then write a bit about what you did and why. Then finish solving, then write about what you did and why. You are supposed to provide in depth reasoning about why you did what you did - you could end up having the completely wrong answer but will still get a lot of credit for simply writing out your reasoning. Most people started off with bad homework grades, but by the end of the course were making As or Bs. Don't get freaked out! You can be successful, and you will learn extremely useful things about mathematics and logical reasoning.Additionally, the grading is very generous. The exam averages are in the 50s and 60s BEFORE the curve. He uses a square root curve so that way most students end up with very high grades on exams. My raw exam grades were typically in the 60s and I would end up with a very high B, or a low to medium A. You also have an opportunity to get extra credit in class participation. Show up to class, attempt problems beforehand, you can easily end up with a 107.5% for your class participation grade, which when I took it, was around 25% of your final grade.I would go so far as to say that if you participate in class fully, make an average on your homework's between 70-100, and just did the parts of the exam that were memorization based/very easy, you'd end up with a B or B+ EASY. It's a good class, it is challenging, and it is very rewarding."

Although pay attention when he does example problems because those are helpful. He is really disorganized and it is never clear what he will be testing us on. There's a dense textbook that has decent examples in it but they are much different than the test material. The software Wiley Plus that we use is nice for homework because it does not penalize you for answering the material incorrectly and it is a good way to master some of the techniques.

Actually one of the worsts texts i've ever read. Just watch the MIT opencourse ware if you don't get something. Not really a heavy workload class at all. For the online homework, you get unlimited tries and after five attempts it will tell you how to do the problem and the answer (no,  I am not kidding). First two exams were fair for the most part but each had one trick question that threw people off then the final exam was extremely fair. He has a policy where if you get above a 90 on the final, it counts as your whole grade and frankly speaking the final was easy (you get a page front and back cheat sheet). Overall, be prepared to put in a decent amount of time teaching yourself the material and there were times when this course was frustrating but it is overall not very hard and sometimes enjoyable."

Abdesselam is not a great professor - he spends a lot of time on theory that you don't need to know.  Most of the lectures just went over my head and I taught myself the rest either from the textbook (which is mediocre) or from paul's online math notes.  This isn't exactly an easy A class, but if you put in the work to understand the hw examples, you will get an A.  Exams were almost straight from the hw except for a trick question per exam (since the whole class got those wrong, he just curved up).One thing though - the TA was absolutely horrible and useless : ("

            "text": "This course is fairly easy and not too much work. The first section of the material is basically what I learned in AP Calc in high school and Calc II at UVa, and the new material in the first section related to what we covered in Calc III! The second section of the material is basically Linear Algebra, which I haven't taken before, but many students in the class did. I found this material very confusing for a while but once I sat down and worked through the homework to understand what I was doing, it wasn't too bad. Personally, I believe the course needs some restructuring so there isn't so much overlap in material...\nInitially, I was wary of taking this class because the other reviews I read mentioned that Abdessalem was awkward and a bad lecturer. Once I started the course, I realized quickly that Abdessalem is actually quite a good teacher, one of the better ones I've had here. He's very attentive to explaining the material in a way we can understand, and whenever he hears someone talking behind him he turns around and says \"Question?\", which rarely anyone had (they were just talking), but it means he wants to address confusion during the lecture. Even though I think he's a good lecturer, I think he wasn't very good at explaining the physical representation of what we were doing, and because of this I was often confused about why we were doing what we were doing. We mainly focused on learning the process and mechanics of solving systems of differential equations without analyzing what it means to have a fundamental system of solutions, or what these systems could possibly represent.\nAs others have mentioned, the homework isn't too bad. There was usually one assignment a week through the online WileyPlus software. They usually took a few hours to complete. During our semester, we were allowed unlimited attempts to answer questions, but we were never explicitly given the answer as another reviewer mentioned. As a side note, WileyPlus might be the worst website I've ever used in my life. The interface is slow and unintuitive, and the website frequently had problems.\nExams were straightforward for the most part and if you study you'll do well on them. The first exam did not have a very high average, and as a result Abdessalem kind of panicked about us all doing poorly in the class. He curved the test, allowed us to have a cheat sheet for the second exam (which wasn't the policy before), and changed his grading so if you did better on the second exam and final, you could still do well in the class. Abdessalem really wanted us all to do well and over half the class ended up getting A's.\nAs a final note, I wouldn't say this course was very fun or fulfilling, it was just learning how to solve equations in a pretty dull way, so if that doesn't sound good, probably wouldn't recommend this class to you.\nTL;DR: Easier class, many students got A's, professor is above average, not that fun"

Linear algebra is pretty helpful once you get to systems, which makes learning eigenvalues and eigenvectors a lot less painful.

If I even had to have a knock on him, and this is serious, it is that his handwriting is atrocious so you do have to guess what he is writing sometimes (people thinking his w's are a's, that type of stuff).

He's young and sort of quirky so lectures aren't a bore. He edited his online lectures heavily during Covid-19 (almost in a YouTube style format) so you get the sense he really does care about his work. That being said, the course was difficult. I think I heard the average on the first midterm was a 67 (though this could be wrong... I find it hard to believe it was this low but I know a few people who didn't do well on it.) He is very theory based and spend a lot of time in the abstract rather than doing actual problems. This is also how his exams are. I haven't received my final grade, but I just submitted my final and am likely to get between a B unless he curves the class (which I do not anticipate). You will learn a lot in this course (though he skipped over a chapter which I thought was odd). It is a very light workload though. There are no homeworks. He often gives suggestions of problems to do in the book, but they are usually just proofs to the theorems you learn. I was able to scrape by with a 92 on the first midterm by just rigorously going through everything the entire day before (don't necessarily suggest this, this is just how I study). Definitly take linear algebra before this though. I took this as a 2nd year the semester after I took linear and it was a huge help-- there are a lot of matrix topics/ applications and I could tell the first years in the class who have not taken linear were very confused. It's doable if you haven't taken linear but I don't know why you would choose to take this course first. Overall, if you need to take this course, Braga is a good option. My best advice is just to reallllly understand what's going on conceptually. If you don't the exams will kick your ass as only about half of the problems are \"solving\" differential equations. This was probably the hardest course I've taken here (the final was a killer...) but I don't really know if there are better options. Braga is such a nice guy though so sometimes it distracts from the difficulty of the course. If you have to take it, attend lecture and actually read the textbook for proofs behind the theorems (even if he doesn't go over them). However, it appears now that Braga is really of the strain of professor who believes a calss average should be a C/C+. I don't know anyone who got a A in this class. So while yes you learn a lot, you are likely to suffer GPA wise."

You go to class everyday ready for the curriculum for the day.  I could not recommend him enough.  He takes a complicated subject and makes it interesting and clear."

I would really highly recommend taking diff eq with him. Bourdon runs his class a little differently than what you've probably seen in other  math classes, but it works very well. Everyday there is a handout packet which has definitions, examples, and places for you to work out problems that you go through to learn new concepts.  He also uses the document camera to do examples, gives webassign readings + problems, iClickers questions in class, and a Piazza online Q&A forum which is really helpful for students to ask  for and give help.  There's also plenty of opportunities for extra credit and grading isn't too tough.  A lot of linear algebra concepts come up in this class, so although not  a requirement, it would be really helpful to have before taking diff eq."

Don't take this class unless you are interested in Math, but it has been my favorite class at UVA and Bourdon is the man."

He absolutely loves math, specifically differential equations, but even more so, he loves teaching, which is rare to find amongst professors in the math department at UVA. He is available out of class any time you need him and is one that encourages questions rather than making his students feel stupid for asking them.  He sets up the course so that the final grade is made up of more than a few test and quiz grades. There are 3 unit tests (14% each) which are very fair if you study the (quite extensive/cohesive) study guides and practice tests that he provides and a final exam (20%). There are weekly quizzes in the discussion section (20%) which are made up of 2-3 of the week's respective homework assignments' questions and 1-2 definitions which he provides you with on a weekly basis. Basically, if you do the homework and ask questions when confused, you will be successful on the quizzes. Also, the most interactive part of his class are the daily iClicker questions (10%). Again, Bourdon is very knowledgable about how students best learn math, so he encourages students to discuss/collaborate on these iClicker questions, which really does help everyone understand the material and make friends to work with throughout the semester. There are also short WebAssigns (8%) due before most classes, but they actually help prepare you for what you're going to learn in class that day instead of wasting your time. Lastly, he offers many extra credit opportunities throughout the semester in the form of weekly reflections, posting/answering Piazza questions, and doing real-life application based Mathematica \"projects\" with a partner (which are actually quite fun and not difficult). Overall, I do not think you would regret taking this course with Bourdon at all. He is very fair and truly cares about each of his students. You will learn a lot and have fun doing so in this class!!(:"

Bourdon makes it easy to grasp concepts through a million opportunities to learn (WebAssign readings, workbook problems, class notes that double as study guides) in a way that's about as enjoyable as a math class can be. You can really tell he is passionate about the subject and loves to teach. The tests were pretty doable and the weekly quizzes helped me keep up with all of the material as I went -- the tests and final do not count for that much a piece and he gives you the opportunity to replace your lowest midterm score with your final exam score.

He cares more about teaching and his students than any professor I've ever had, and that feels really great and refreshing since its often not the case.

He truly cares about his students and teaching and makes everything super clear. I had him when everything was on Zoom and his class was honestly my favorite. He made online school almost feel like an in-person class. He walks you through some of the written homework problems in the instructions and the other problems are generally related to classwork or WebAssign homework. Everything we did in that class had a purpose so nothing felt like busywork. Our exams were 20 minute oral exams on zoom but were completely fair. Most people got As! Since you only had 20 minutes, he made sure you understood the general concepts, definitions, theorems, and procedures behind Differential Equations so nothing was meant to trip you up. He is also very relaxed and personable so speaking through problems was not intimidating. I highly recommend making use of office hours too! These will make you more comfortable talking through math problems before the oral exams (if these still happen after Zoom University) and will show him the effort you are making! He is very willing to help and works very hard to help his students. He also made 3 weekly Piazza posts a requirement as part of our grade which was super helpful to get help from classmates and Prof Bourdon himself. As long as you put the work in that he requires, you won't need to spend an insane amount of time on this class, and you'll learn and hopefully enjoy it along the way!"

Ira taught by just writing examples on the board (which were usually all in the book) and then offering little explanation about how/why the formulas and math worked. The homeworks often took upwards of 10 hours a week and that was while working in a group with the majority of the class. They were also graded unnecessarily harshly, albeit this being the grader's fault and not Prof. Herbst's. The one thing I will say about Herbst is that the exams were very fair. He scares you at the beginning of the year by telling you he doesn't curve (which he doesn't as far as I'm aware). But he makes up for it by making the exams manageable. We were all very worried heading into the first exam but I know the large majority of us did well and 3 (out of 17) got 100s. The second exam was harder with an average of around 80 and the final was decent. I think he may have curved the final slightly. Overall, Ira is a pretty bad teacher but not a bad guy."

Each week he gives one written problem set and one WebAssign followed by quizzes in the discussion and classwork once a week. Protip: complete the WebAssigns in advance to get extra credit. This course goes over more existence and uniqueness Theorems than the APMA course so unless required I would recommend taking the APMA course."

Also his cool accent makes it fun listening to him talk.No homework, but there are suggested problems from the book that really help.  The midterms are fair.  The final is challenging but the class is curved.  Participation/attendance grade based on iclickers.  Weekly quizes in discussion section.I was warned about this class being very hard and I'll admit it does cover a LOT of material, but I loved it.  Professor Tosun made it very understandable and was both helpful and polite in office hours.  In this class if you work hard and pay attention then you'll learn alot and probably do well."

Homework was given through WileyPlus, which was pretty awful; however, for most of the semester each homework question had unlimited attempts and after five attempts the solution was given. This was extremely helpful considering WileyPlus is very picky with its answers. There were quizzes given every week during discussion section that weren't too difficult. Neither the homework nor the quizzes helped prepare for the exams; however, a practice exam with solutions was handed out about a week before the actual exam. I would recommend Professor Tosun for this course."

As mentioned below, the text used for this course is a book he and his wife are trying to get published. This wouldn't be a problem except for the fact a lot of answers to practice problems are missing from the back of the book and the type of problems provided for learning the material aren't really geared towards helping you learn the material. Instead, the practice problems exist for providing challenges to those who already know the material. Lectures from are normally straight from the text book, example by example and sometimes even word by word. This is great for seeing how the book examples work out, but this ultimately prevents you from seeing other types of problems workt. This creates a huge issue with the homework. Homeworks are time consuming, ask questions on the material you aren't normally prepared to handle and are often tricky. The homeworks can take upwards of 8 hours some weeks. This is pretty awful considering there are about 5-10 problems due a week. Go see the TA if you are struggling, they will help you through the the homework. (Scott was a great TA and I recommend him for any classes he teaches). For as awful as the homeworks were, the tests were very fair and manageable excluding the final. The final was something out of left field in my opinion, very foreign in terms of difficulty and the questions asked. Overall this class is good, but not great. Despite all the negativity i have voiced towards this class, this is probably your best option for getting through differential equations. An A in this class is very possible if one is willing to put in the time and effort.\n(To give this review validity and not just make it seem like I'm blowing steam, I did get an A)"

Basic Real Analysis is notorious for being one of the hardest classes required of math/stat majors, but I think that Tom did a pretty good job of explaining these abstract and complicated topics. He's quirky and has a good sense of humor, which made him very approachable. The final grade is made up of mostly your homework grade (40%), then 2 midterms (15% each), a final exam (20%) and weekly definitions quizzes (10%). The midterms contained a few definitions, T/F questions (with justification) and 2 proofs that were done previously done in class. He typically hinted at the proofs that would appear on the midterms which meant if you studied/memorized those proofs, you had a good chance on being successful on those questions. The final exam contains an open-note, take home portion of 3-4 proofs, which is due on the day of the scheduled final, and a sit-down portion which has a similar format to the midterms, just a bit longer.  Overall, Tom made this difficult class bearable and I would recommend taking this course with him if it is required for your major."

The class material was difficult, but also very rewarding, and I felt like I had a strong grasp of the material after taking it with him. One thing that he did which I enjoyed was having us do presentations on various topics that weren't covered in class (metric spaces, for example), with people receiving extra credit for attending the presentations and writing reports on them.\nI will note that one weak area of the class is the exams, which are structured oddly. The first exam and part of the final exam were both proof-based, which meant that we were supposed to memorize a set of proofs beforehand and then be able to reprove some of them on the exam. I personally felt like this was a bit too heavy on the memorization side, and didn't reward mastery of the material as much as the conceptual exam sections. The first exam also had a very strange grading structure that was difficult to understand and resulted in grades having large jumps (for example, losing one point on the exam could give you a 99%, while losing two could give you a 90%). I also heard of people getting large amounts of points off on the proof based section of the exam, despite having relatively fine proofs."

His midterms were also alright; some of the questions were from the textbook. Other questions were tough, but I guess that's too be expected.\nApart from that, I'd recommend avoiding any class with him. He regularly came to class not knowing the proofs he was going to teach us. It was super frustrating, and made it really difficult to learn. I basically taught myself using the textbook because his lectures were so useless. Honestly - he's one of the worst professors I've had at UVA. I hope he gets better, since I had him his first semester here, but I cannot recommend him."

It's still a very difficult class, but if you know how to best utilize the resources given to you, then you should be okay.\nLet me break down the grading:Homework (20%): These were pretty much weekly check-ins on material covered. Some of the problems are easier/harder than others, but our absolute godsend of a TA would provide extremely helpful hints in case we were ever lost. Also, find a friend to work with, and these definitely won't be a problem. Two of these were dropped.Quizzes (5%): These were weekly, and during our discussion section. There were always two problems: one was one or more definitions, another was more definition applications (prove this, disprove that, etc.). These weren't difficult if you knew each definition like the back of your hand (easier said than done, but again, it's very doable). One of these were dropped.Midterms (15% each): 3 in total. There are 5 problems, done in class, but he only counts the 4 best (so you could leave one blank, or guess, or whatever). Again, these weren't terrible, but they're certainly more difficult than the homeworks (maybe since it's closed-book), and the third midterm in particular was a time-crunch, but it's still very feasible. There usually were 1-2 true/false problems (with maybe 4 questions per problem), and were the easiest part. If you want to prepare for these problems, the textbook has some very similar to what you'll receive. The remaining problems were proof-based; either you were walked through a new proof, or you had to straight-up prove something.Final (30%): Done during the exam period, it should only really take 90-120 minutes, but you're given all 3 hours. Basically a longer midterm, but solely with the proofs. The professor gave us a review beforehand that contained some of the problems word for word, so do them all!\nThe professor is very nice and considerate, and he's still new to UVA, so this class will only get better. Use the textbook! Overall, I'd recommend this class with him."

            "text": "Prof. Lu's lectures were sup-par but he made up for it through his reasonable and flexible expectations with respect to homework and exams. The biggest issue with lectures was that they were a little disorganized. He covered all the content we needed but theorems were rarely named and it was sometimes difficult to tell what was important or to line up his definitions and theorems from those in the textbook. Additionally, he struggled to answer questions to a satisfying extent. However, he listened to input from the class on several occasions and adjusted homework deadlines accordingly in order to avoid overloading us. Obviously, it was still a lot since it's an infamously hard class, but he did his best to keep it reasonable. It was the same story with the final exam; everyone struggled with the last midterm more than expected, so he made an obvious effort to keep the final exam reasonable."

Other students and I mentioned they were lengthy for the time we were given, but I can't say what the overall opinion of the class was. They had reasonable questions though.\nThe class is a lot of work to get a good grade. Participation was 10%, HW 15%, and 3 exams were 25% each. The final was cumulative. Pretty solid breakdown, in my opinion. A/B grades are definitely attainable."

Looking at enrollment right now the class started off at 36 and is now at 10 students and there is a reason why. I personally do not come to lecture already knowing all the proofs and theorems but it feels like I have to in order to understand what is going on. I understand that Professor Braga is extremely smart, but that does not mean that I can understand everything he says. Everything gone over in class is also fairly unorganized as everything is coming from his head in real-time and I personally had a hard time following along. There is no textbook reading to follow, or resources to look at except his lectures. He seems like a very nice guy, but the GPA average of a 2.4 also says a lot. For students like myself trying to enter graduate school, this could be a huge deal breaker and make it impossible to try and enjoy the class forget even learning anything from it. I really hope that professor Braga can improve and help his students succeed because even though the class is not taught well, I know that that's his goal."

It's definitely a tough course, especially if it's your first proof-based course, but I found it worthwhile."

Ramirez seems to understand that this is the case for most students and makes it as painless as possible. Your grade consists of 7 quizzes which are unbelievably easy and you only need to do well on 5 to get the full credit which is worth 10% and then 3 midterms each worth 30%.  The tests are a little bit of a shit-show. You have to write out proofs which he tells you ahead of time and are easy if you're good at memorization, and the rest is true/false, no justification.  This can become a little bit of a guessing game and can be frustrating when your grade depends so heavily on knowing the fine details about certain things. But there is no work at all other than that. The material itself is pretty interesting. You get an idea about why the things you learn in calculus are true which I thought was really cool. Ramirez himself is a boss. He has an extremely dry sense of humor, which I appreciated immensely, and interjects interesting anecdotes/facts/useful applications whenever he can.

Tests questions are based off HW questions so if you know how to do the hw, you get decent grades.His lectures are not great (kinda bad actually). He talks a lot during class (this man never stops talking), but he doesn't take time to explain important concepts. (Ex: :Because of theorem xyz, we know this ______. \" But he doesn't explain why theorem xyz actually allows us to conclude _____). I think to really understand his lectures, you have to read the book first to get a sense of what he talks about during lecture.But if you go to his office hours, he is super friendly and will go over the concepts with you (ask questions tho). I think I learned all the important concepts in office hours.Conclusion: It's not the world's worst idea to take this class with Professor Grujic. Material is hard and lectures are bleh, but grades are good and office hours are great. Take it if you have no better option (since UVA math dept as a whole seems to be wack)"

Professor Koberda is incredibly smart and kind, and he (along with the greatest TA ever, Alec Traaseth) made this course fun and mind-blowing. I have never learned so much in such a short period of time. This class made my other classes seem trivial. Yet I never feared for my grade because Professor Koberda made it clear that he prioritized our learning above everything. Looking back, I learned all of my other introductory math courses in 3 weeks in this course.  I don't feel like I missed a thing.  I highly recommend getting together a group with your classmates and working on the homework sets--you will find solace in mutual suffering. But be advised--you will have a lot of fun learning, especially from such a legendary professor. I mean seriously, look this guy up. He's the GOAT. Koberda makes me want to get a PhD in math just because of this class. Who else can manage that?!!?"

It will probably be the hardest class you'll take for a while, but it's totally worth it. Professor Koberda is the best instructor I've ever had, and he's super cool. He's extremely humble, so he'll never admit it, but he's a very impressive person. Highly recommend  going to office hours, use the TA, work in groups, and read outside of the course. The course has no textbook, but you can download free Linear Algebra textbooks from Springer. Same with ODE. You should definitely do that. If you can get your hands on a copy of Linear Algebra Done Right (I found it for free on the Springer website) definitely use it as a resource, Professor Koberda likes that book and it follows the course really well."

This series was easily the hardest set of classes I've ever taken and will ever take, but is also easily the most rewarding class I think I will ever take. You'd be hard-pressed to find a professor as kind and humble that is this mind-blowingly intelligent and interesting (seriously, ask him a question about anything math-related or otherwise and your life will be changed). This class turned me into a math major, even though I never thought that would be something in my future. This class is an even better example than 2315 about how much you can really learn in a short period of time; we covered advanced linear algebra, all of the material in an intro ODE course, and then additional topics to top it off, all in one semester even with going online and losing a week of class. Again, don't worry about your grade; as long as you improve and show that you care about the class by diligently showing up to class and office hours and doing the problem sets, you'll be fine. Prof. Koberda is the GOAT and literally only cares that you soak up as much information as you can. Work in groups with classmates on the problem sets, utilize your TA and office hours, and have a fantastic semester with the best math professor at this university and probably the most precious person on this Earth."

Also, DO NOT jump into this without having taken the first course. With that out of the way, this class finishes the content from Elementary Linear Algebra (3351) that you began last semester, makes it through much of the content from Advanced Linear Algebra (4651), and completes Ordinary Differential Equations (3255). It is exactly the same as its precursor, and it is just as great. Honestly, this semester really puts into perspective just how much you have learned and why the content that you have learned is useful, so it is truly enlightening. If you took 2315, are planning on taking this class, and have not yet become friends with Koberda, please do so immediately. Ask him anything about academia, his life, or some random topic—he definitely has something interesting to say. Finally, I encourage you not to think that everyone who takes this course is a masochist—we are honestly normal people. If you made it through the first semester, you will know what I mean. Oh, there is also one more thing: if you are entering this course and haven't done so already, take a look at getting \"Linear Algebra Done Right,\" by Sheldon Axler (there is a problem-less version for free on his website), and bookmark some of the free lecture notes and textbooks from this page https://realnotcomplex.com/algebra/linear-algebra. Good luck."

This class was interesting and you learn a lot, but had some proof focus that I did not understand. Ryan is a new, but good instructor. This class had a lot of work including in-class activities, WebAssign, and written homework, and had a quiz every 1-2 weeks in class. I found that the weight of each assignment was fair and the exams aren't weighed too much (3 exams and a final for a total of 33%). One of the issues I had with the course was the inconsistency with the grading, as the TA would grade much harder than the professor which led to some shocks when I got some grades back. Overall, I think its a good class if you are interested, but difficult if you are taking it as an elective. #tCFF23"

He is very understanding and willing to push back the schedule to give us more time to master material, even if that means we cover less material overall. There are three midterms and a final worth 40% of your grade, and each of them have the opportunity to get bonus points. The quizzes are quick and normally just cover one lecture. I will say WebAssign and Written Homeworks were the most difficult part of the course, but he dropped 15% of the WebAssign questions and you didn't have to do every question on the written homeworks for full points. If you are a decent student you will get a 90+ in this class, I heard multiple people before the final saying they needed something like a 50 on it to get an A. This is a course with a lot of assignments, but they are graded nicely and not too time consuming, cannot recommend it enough. #tCFF23"

            "text": "Petrov is probably the worst professor I've had at UVA. He seems like he does not want to be teaching the course at all at often seems annoyed when students ask questions. He is a very lazy and disorganized lecturer and seems to just go over the material just off the top of his head without preparation. This only became worse when the course went online. He started uploading like 2-3 asynchronous lectures a week that totaled to maybe 2 hours, but then we also just had a mandatory meeting on Thursdays that were the regular class time of 1:15 or longer. For reference, a week of lectures should only be 2 and a half hours total. It would be fine if his lectures were any good but they were even worse than they were in person. He somehow managed to take sections from our textbook that would take maybe like 20-30 minutes to read and then would record a 1 hour lecture that covered less material in a way more confusing way. But you couldn't afford to just read the textbook because he would sometimes include material not included in the textbook that would show up on quizzes and exams.\nThe online exams were hell. The first in person exam was super super easy. The second exam, which was online, wasn't too bad, but he made the computations really long and tedious since it was open note. The final was terrible. It was 9 problems, and most of them were substantially more difficult than what we had done all year. One of the questions included a topic outside of the textbook that he brought up in lecture except he didn't even complete a full example problem when he went over it. That final took me around 12 hours to complete.\nThe homeworks are inconsistent. Some take maybe an hour while others can take 4-5, depending on how poorly he covered the material. The worst one was the very last one which took 12 hours because he decided it would be a good idea to cover 2 whole chapters in a week.\nOn top of just Petrov just being an objectively terrible professor, he was very inconsiderate to me personally. I switched into his class close to the add/drop deadline because I had to resolve a scheduling issue first and missed the first two weekly quizzes. I asked if I could make them up or have them dropped, but he said that it was my fault because I didn't show enough  interest to sign up for the class originally. On the syllabus, it said he would drop one quiz, but that still meant I would start off with a 0 for a quiz and also not be able to drop one later. Although it was annoying at the time, I didn't push too hard cause I could still make it up at that point with a quiz every week and quizzes only counting for around 7% of our grade. I only got to take 3 quizzes before COVID hit and Petrov decided not to give quizzes anymore since we were online. On the first quiz I took, I only studied the textbook cause his lectures were ass, but one of two questions was on something that was exclusively covered in lecture, so I got a 50 on it. The other two quizzes were fine, but my quiz average at this point was like a 60% even with the dropped quiz. I asked him again towards the end of the semester if I could just drop the two quizzes I missed given that I didn't get a chance to bring my grade up because of the pandemic. This asshole still tells me no and said that I'd be fine because I did well on the first two exams anyways. I ended having to get a full letter grade higher on the final (the one that was a 12 hour nightmare) just to get the grade I would have gotten had I not switched in the class late.\nTLDR: Professor is an inconsiderate asshole with disorganized and confusing lectures."

But, all the tests are curved because everyone did so poorly on them, so everyone ended doing well in the class. Also, I'm pretty sure he never graded the last half of the homeworks or weekly quizzes, since he stopped giving them back to us the second week of classes."

Because it's an applied class, those examples help and are expected to be useful for those of us who are not math majors but still have to know the material.

The only kind of \"proof\" that we are expected is the True/False Questions on the exam where you have to explain your reasoning such as proving by counter example, but not a full mathematical proof. Overall, if you are not a math major who needs linear algebra in your area of study, take it with Holt. Fairly easy as he steps through multiple examples in each topic and kind of questions you will encounter in a midterm or final exam. He wrote the textbook but I found it difficult to read. But if you go to class, he literally summarizes the important points and you won't need to read it over. The textbook is only for the homework or if you miss class and need to catch up. There is also a R programming part, but it is open notes (including example R files) and open book so its just free points for grabs. Homework is not graded so you don't have to be stressed to turn it in every time. Just practice these problems a couple nights before the exam and you'll be fine. Holt is also a great professor who explains things very clearly and he is very fair when it comes to exams."

Homework assignments are *juuusssttt* long enough to concretize the material in your head, without being excessive. Tests are incredibly fair, Holt is exceptionally generous with partial credit, and grades will usually be posted to Collab within 48 hours. Also, Holt has a \"quasi-dutch-knockout\" where if you do better on the final exam questions that correspond to the material from your worst midterm, he'll replace the bad grade with the corresponding better section of the final. Also, there is an open-note, open-internet R (programming) exam that basically gives you free points to cushion any exam mistakes.\nAs a whole, this was a very fun, fair class, with a very nice professor.

I found the quizzes to be a little inconsistent and definitely difficult but all in all manageable. The rest of your grade is made up of homework (completion) and in-class assignments (accuracy) and the in-class assignments are done in groups. I would definitely recommend taking this class sooner rather then later because Prof. Holt really set this class up so that people can succeed even though it is all online. I might even dare to say that this class is easier online then it is in person just because of the lack of tests but I guess there's no way to know for sure. Prof. Holt is without a doubt the best math/stats professor I have had a UVA and I think most people will find him really kind and willing to help.

Disclaimer: I am writing this as a first year that has only taken math classes with McMillan, so I can't really compare him with any other math professors.For someone that was not a math major, McMillan is a very accommodating professor. For a class like 3350 (fundamentally an elective class), McMillan is pretty generous with his curves, and makes himself very available during and outside of lecture. When taking his class, I felt as if the class was more of a collaborative effort with the students and him to structure and learn the content, and he always asked how we felt about content, if we were lost, etc. It's for this reason that I recommend McMillan because he really is invested in making his students learn the content and learn math conceptually rather than procedurally.That being said, McMillan wants you to learn math as logical deductions, not as procedures to memorize, and that's a skill that you have to develop while in class. You will have to spend a lot of time sitting down and think about the material. You will be asked to walk through the explanations for derivations, and it is slightly harder than what other professors offer for 3350. If you give it the time it needs, it becomes a bit easier to read the dense material, but you do need to come into lecture doing the readings if you want to know what's actually going on.I highly recommend McMillan if you don't have all that many hard classes for the semester you take it with him. By the end of the course, I was personally able to actually \"read\" math, and I found his cordial demeanor really helpful when asking stupid questions about content and the like. However, if you have a busy schedule, you may want to take the course another time, but I would not pass up McMillan just because he is a difficult professor. #tCFS24"

Material is initially easy, problems later on get quite challenging, and expect a lot of True or False questions regarding matrix properties (e.g. span, subspace, basis, linear independence, etc.). The topics build on each other. Matt didn't adjust well to the online format, had trouble with Gradescope and posting lecture videos, but he was a pretty chill guy. He was really helpful in group work but this class is basically teaching yourself with the videos and/or textbook."

The class was taught poorly, the homeworks took way too long, and the exams were never as she said they would be. Homeworks took hours on end to only be worth 7% of my grade but also if i happen to skip over one problem out of the 37 billion problems she assigns i immediately get a 50% which does impact your grade drastically.  I went to her OH and she would always contradict herself and never explain much well. I ended up reading the text book and watching khan academy to help me a lot. overall i suggest you take it with holt he is a way better professor and is also not condescending and rude to students."

There is also a ton of material - while tests aren't particularly hard for any one concept, she makes her tests cover 30 different concepts that could possibly be tested, and the format of the tests (lots of questions) make it difficult if you can't wrap your head around a question immediately.  She means well and is helpful in OH, but I think she expected too much out of her students. I would have liked to see the material, especially tests, broken up more so that any one test didn't cover a boatload of information."

She was enthusiastic, engaging, interesting, funny, and generally cared about how the students were doing in the class. She was well-prepared and eased students into the proofs the class requires. If you are taking linear algebra and she is teaching it, I strongly recommend taking it with her. She wants you to succeed and enjoy the math you are learning. The only thing I regret about the course was not going to office hours more and getting to know her better. Super cool person."

The class is not an easy A; however, I can guarantee you will walk out of Prof. Morse's class very knowledgable about Linear Algebra. The class consists of 3 exams (each 25%, unless you do better on each one, which she'll weight you highest grade more than the others), a homework grade (15%, each assignment is quite lengthy and all from the textbook, but is very useful!) and a participation grade (10%, just show up and sign the attendance sheet). If you feel like you're falling behind or did not perform very well on a test, I highly suggest going to talk to Prof. Morse. She will help you so much to catch you up to speed without being condescending or making you feel dumb. I realized this about halfway through the semester and started going to all of her office hours, and soon enough, I built a rapport with her and felt very comfortable asking her questions. By the end of the semester, I knew 100% what was going on, and I accredit that entirely to how patient and helpful Prof. Morse is. Again, if you have to take MATH 3351 or want a class to help build your skills with proofs, take it with Prof. Morse!"

She was wildly inconsistent with posting homework, sometimes only 2-3 days in advance, even though she said we'd have a week to do them. Grading was mostly exam based (the exams aren't exactly easy, or curved, either), but she does give us a bunch of busy work, as mentioned above. She gave us lecture homework with the intent of letting us know how well we're grasping the concepts, but never returned them to us. I could be doing well in this class right now, or I could be failing, who knows? She skips all of the application sections, so why is this class useful? Again, who knows? She also seldom responded to us when we asked her questions in the chat in Collab, such as \"is there homework for this week?\" or \"do we need to know what A^T is?\" opting instead for either not addressing the question in its entirety or not addressing the question at all. This class was HEAVILY proof-based, with her asking us to prove stuff on exams, so if you don't like proofs/are bad at proofs, take the applied versions of Linear Algebra. If you take this class with Professor Morse, good luck."

Not only is she passionate about the subject, but she is an engaging and approachable lecturer as well; she encourages questions during class and encourages students to think beyond the course or exam material.\nIn terms of the grade distribution, there is class participation (5%), homeworks (10% and basically graded on completion), midterm 1 (25%), midterm 2 (30%), and midterm 3 (30%). The midterms can be challenging, particularly because Professor Morse  introduces some proofs in this course – so the midterms often consist of some computational and some proof-based questions. However, as long as you study hard, it is achievable to perform well on these exams. Ultimately, I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in actually developing an understanding of concepts in linear algebra, instead of simply memorizing and applying formulas. After taking this course, I think most students' understanding of linear algebra is much better than it was before."

If you prove that you're putting in effort then she'll be happy to help.

His homework was all long and hard proofs (required proof-writing experience from MATH 3000, which I did not have). His take-home tests are just as long as the homework but the difference is that you get 2 days compared to a week for the same amount of time.

Then you have written homework due every Wednesday, video responses due every Friday, a group project, responses for other groups' projects.  The crazy thing is, all this only makes 30% of your grade.\nThe other 70% is comprised of your midterm and final grades.\nThe graders and Bergner herself are also extremely anal in grading, often taking 25-50% of points off on homework and tests off for \"not explaining enough\" or not showing all steps or starting from a specific equation.  She's also mentioned multiple times how she will dock points off your homework if you forget to rip the notebook perforations off your paper, and got angry when someone referred to the page of notes you get in an exam as a \"cheat sheet\" then went off on how the \"cheat sheet\" goes against the honor code and instead, we should call it an \"instructor permitted sheet of notes.\""

She is tough, but she's not out to get you. It is a TON of work, but it's also a 3000 level math class that is fundamental to a lot of other courses. Linear Algebra pops up in many different other subjects, so I'm glad that I have a good understanding of it. Also, I'm bad at studying for math, so I think it is helpful to have a lot of small assignments along the way to force me to keep up with the material. You are forced to study a little bit every day. The online homework is super easy (you have unlimited attempts), but can be very tedious. The written homework is graded very harshly, but it's only worth 5% of your grade. I found the projects interesting. They helped me understand how linear algebra is used in real life. I also liked seeing other people's projects, but it was just a lot to write about. My advice if you take this class with her is to get ahead and do all the video responses early, because most people waited till the end, and it was a lot of work to do at the end of the semester. Also, this was her first time teaching this class,  so she will probably make improvements in the following semesters."

He is definitely a contender for my worst teacher to date. Let me explain!He teaches from notes taken straight from the book, exact wording and definitions. The point of having a teacher is to have someone who is able to explain and clearly illustrate concepts that seem dense in the book, making them easier to understand, but unfortunately for this class it was the complete opposite. I stopped going to class and just read the book because he would manage to make these concepts even more incomprehensible. His methods of explanation include terminology such as (actual quote) \"and thus this means that thing over there\". He will then attempt to cover for himself, asking multiple times if anyone has questions after nervously shifting around because he can perceive that the class has no idea what he's trying to explain. No one asked questions because he would deliver the same explanation as the first time, concluding with a reaffirming \"yeah, so that's how\".Furthermore, he was just entirely uninspiring and unenthusiastic. He did not explain big concepts, put anything in perspective, it felt like we were just learning formulas to solve a certain set of problems with no overarching connection or relation that gives you the \"ah hah!\" moment. Very disappointing class."

Lectures with Zezhou were proving a theorem and doing practice problems. They were pretty boring and by the latter half of the semester only about half the students were showing up. There is one homework assigned per week, which usually takes one to two hours. There were three tests (Two midterms and a final). The first two midterms were basically the exact same structure: one page of true/false, one page of circle all that are true, and a few pages of solving some problems. The exams are relatively straight-forward (the problems just test if you know how to apply some concept), but the tricky part is the true and false since each question is worth 6 points and the tests are only worth 80 points. The true and false requires pretty deep understanding of the topics.\nMy review may be biased because I came into the course knowing some of the topics already, but I feel like if I didn't know anything about linear coming into this class, it would be a lot harder. Some of the topics went by fast"

His exams, however, can be tricky because you need to know the theorems pretty well, but the calculations are very simple algebra. He is a pretty dull lecturer so only half of the class shows up. Good thing is, you can still go to class once a week to hand in your homework and still do well if you read the textbook VERY carefully and actually understand your homework instead of looking up answers. The calculations in Linear Algebra are very easily self-taught but the concepts behind them might need some explanation. Overall, I don't think he was a bad professor. Even if it was a different professor, I still wouldn't have gone to class."

Was not a huge fan of this professor, it felt pretty awkward during class time to ask anything because I didn't know what to ask to clarify what he was teaching."

It's ok if you don't understand his spoken English!He always welcomed questions though most of the time he couldn't understand the questions when students spoke too fast. But once he understood, he would try his best to answer them and made sure he gave the answers students wanted.One of the best thing of the class was that the grade came out very fast.

One time I went to him for help and it was clear he did not want to help me, and he was very rude and condescending. I definitely recommend choosing a different professor."

She was very thorough in explaining the theorems and concepts needed, as well as the proofs for each of the concepts and how they connected with each other. She was extremely organized and knowledgeable, completely answering every question that came up during class with a good level of detail. The content itself is abstract, learning about abstract algebra and how we can use that (at least early on) for the algebra we learned in elementary school. The further into the class you go, the more abstract it gets, which simultaneously makes it more interesting yet less tangible. The homeworks were not too difficult, with grades and corrections getting back quickly. The exams were very difficult in my opinion, but she curves graciously. She is easy to get ahold of on Piazza for quick questions, and basically begs for everyone to come to her office hours to discuss the homework and content. I did not and I saw the err of my ways. If you have free time, go to office hours. It is an interesting class, and with Professor Gazaki you get an enjoyable class experience that gives you what you put into it."

            "text": "Survey of Algebra with You Qi is an experience. He has a unique grading structure (15% homework, 25% midterm, 25% split across five quizzes with one drop, and 35% final). The material in Survey is very difficult, and You is, for the most part, very good at talking through it in lecture, but there will certainly be days you'll be completely lost, and he's not amazing in office hours, but going to office hours isn't a terrible idea. You is a very nice man who is more than happy to walk you through any question, but it's not always helpful. In class he does a very good job of making sure students are following, and he happily responds to any question in lecture. You also posts his notes for the entire semester on Canvas, unit by unit, and the course does not use a textbook, so studying is incredibly easy because his notes are well-organized and have all the information needed. Having his notes as a backup when I was not confident in my own was very helpful. Likewise, if you need to miss a lecture, he will record the class and post the recording, no questions asked, a very nice rarity in the math department.As for the assignments, the weekly homeworks are very difficult; certainly more difficult than what is covered in lecture, but this is to be expected. As the semester progressed, I think his grader realized how difficult they were, and as a result, for the latter half of the semester they were graded quite generously. This is also helped by the low (15%) impact of homework on grades. The quizzes are extremely fair, and are good ways to make sure you are keeping up with the material. Likewise, the midterm was very easy and a proper way to encapsulate the first half of the course. You Qi then proceeded to drop a final exam from hell, so study hard for the final.All in all, a fine experience and a doable A, but the final hit everyone like a brick. You Qi is a fine instructor to take Survey of Algebra with, but there are assuredly better professors out there. #tCFS24"

To start off, professor Maloni knows the material really well and genuinely cares about her students. Sometimes, she even brings cookies and brownies to class. The material is really tough, however, and it doesn't help when the grader for this course is also really tough. The grader will only pick a few problems from the homework to grade, so even if you do all 6-8 problems of the homework, he will only grade 2-3 of them. Grading every problem for everyone's homework is a lot to ask for one grader, but even if you write a long solution, it's still possible you get a 0 on that question. Seriously, I got two 50's in a row for missing just a couple questions on each homework.Overall, although it was a tough class, Maloni tries really hard to make sure you understand the material."

The readings are super useful but are rather hard to understand, and its super important to properly participate in classwork to be able to keep up. I felt as if office hours were almost mandatory to this class, as Professor Maloni offers so much help and feedback that streamlined my homework and learning processes.

I didn't like this structure at all, especially when the content started to get hard. Sara's very nice and understanding though. She's willing to answer any questions and can understand if you need an extension or anything.\nThe class was graded with 25% weekly HW, 25% Midterms, 25% Final, 15% Community Project, and 10% participation. She grades leniently, so the 2 midterms weren't bad at all (plus she gives practice exams which were typically harder than the actual exam). Even the final wasn't that hard. Homeworks were harder than the exams, but getting at least an 80-90 wasn't hard for each hw. The community project was an easy 100 - we just made an activity and shared it with some high schoolers.\nDefinitely a hard class, but also very doable. Take it with Sara if she's teaching it!"

Additionally, Professor Balderrama is extremely organized. I really appreciated his clarity of speech during lecture and the methodical, reasonable pace at which he explained concepts. Moreover, he posted all his lecture notes and a ton of practice exercises, so I never had to consult external sources for studying help. As a final note, which may be applicable to math minors, I have also taken Basic Real Analysis, and contrary to popular opinion, I don't think it's objectively harder than Survey! It just depends on your interests; I do not have much experience working with computers and I like calculus, so Basic Real felt more intuitive to me."

One nice thing about the homeworks was that we were assigned groups to work in, which was a significant relief.\nHowever, I did have several problems with the way he structured the course. For one, I was disappointed with some of the decisions on what to cover. We didn't cover rings or fields at all, which was very disappointing as I would consider covering those to be a fairly vital part of the course material. Instead, we spent three days near the end of the course proving the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, which, while useful, did not deserve so much attention when compared to topics that we were actually supposed to cover."

He expects a lot from his students and can seem a bit intimidating at first, but he is one of the most effective teachers I've had for a math class and is a teacher who truly tries to get to know every one of his students individually. I highly recommend going to office hours on a weekly basis and forming a good relationship with him because it will make you feel much more comfortable asking questions. The set up of the course is great. There are typically weekly homework assignments (15% of overall grade), but they are easy to do well on because each problem is presented by someone in the class so you will know what the right answers are before turning in the final product. Those homework presentations make up your participation grade (10% of final grade). As long as you present 2-3 times throughout the semester, you will get the full credit for participation! There are two mandatory exams during the semester which make up 37.5% of your grade each.  This makes the final exam optional. He gives you a \"preliminary\" grade about a week before the scheduled final exam, so if you're happy with your \"preliminary\" grade being you final course grade, you don't have to take the final! If not, you can take the final exam, and the two midterm exams instead make up 25% of your grade each, as does the final exam (75% of course grade made up of exams). If you're able to take 3354 with Ken, DO IT. It was a great pleasure to learn from such an accomplished mathematician (seriously, just check out his Wikipedia page!!)."

If you are struggling with the course material, Professor Pun provides ample assistance both in her office hours and on the Piazza discussion board. If, on the other hand, you find the material relatively straightforward, there are plenty of problems in Pun's assignments that are reasonably challenging when approached alone. Additionally, Pun's offers extra credit problem sets that go beyond the course material and introduce concepts generally covered in Introduction to Abstract Algebra (4652). There are quite a few definitions, theorems, and examples that you are expected to learn over the semester, but it is certainly doable if you consistently study your notes and complete the assignments. Once again, talk to Pun if you are ever having trouble; she is very friendly, and more than happy to help.\nOne great aspect of this course is Pun's notes on OneNote. They are easy-to-access, well-organized, and incredibly neat. Writing your own notes is by far the best way to study the material, but I often found myself flipping through her notes instead of my own when working on assignments. When I took the course, Pun required participation on a Piazza discussion forum, and the forum was very active as a result. In fact, you could generally get an answer to any question within an hour, either from other students or from the professor herself. This cultivated an active and supportive environment that made the course much, much easier. I highly recommend participating in Piazza discussions if you have the chance.\nOverall, I highly recommend taking this course with Pun if you have the chance. You will learn a lot of basic-but-fundamental material---at a good pace from a friendly and clear professor. And if you put in adequate effort both in and out of class, you should end with a reasonable grade, as he does her best to give you the best grade possible considering your various homework, exam, and extra credit scores."

That extra effort, however, did translate into expectations that were not properly adjusted at times.\nPun is a pretty hard grader, but the problem sets were graded by graders, whom she warned us \"were not always through\" and  told us to consult her answer problem sets. However, this still did not give enough of an understanding of how exactly she would grade on exams, and she often showed no leniency whatsoever, telling us that if we didn't do well, it was because we didn't study enough or didn't read her solutions, disregarding the fact that even if we tried on the exams, if it wasn't exactly what she wanted we might as well as have not done the problem.\nIn addition, she did not curve the class, rather her \"curve\" was just adjusting the weighing of different things (7 homework assignments since 2 were dropped, the two midterms and the final). Given the averages on the first two exams were both below 65% iirc and she had to change the grading policy to a more completion based approach about 4 weeks in, it is not surprising that she told us if we had gotten a definite grading scale at the end of the semester, most of us would have failed, but honestly I didn't really appreciate the implication that she's doing us some kind of favor by barely adjusting her own teaching and grading habits so most of us don't fail.\nI don't doubt that the class is inherently difficult, but Pun definitely exacerbated the difficulty unnecessarily with how much she expected and her general unwillingness to take any kind of criticism(as evidenced by the fact that she thought it was necessary to write a full on 3 page essay responding to our course evaluations). It is also worth noting that most people ended up choosing to take the class for credit instead of for a grade. I think if you have to take the class with her, it is not the worst but just be aware of what you're getting yourself into."

I think that all upper-level MATH courses should allow students time to consider problems completely and look over all of the information they have learned throughout the semester to do so with take-home exams. Professor Ying Pun mentioned that this was a result of MATH department policy, but I had other classes with take-home exams, so I am unsure if this is true. Professor Ying Pun also required us to post a minimum number of Piazza posts over the course of the semester, which I thought was a little silly."

He often talks quietly into the board and doesn't leave much time for anything but the simplest practice problems or questions. There are weekly homework assignments consisting of about 8-10 problems/proofs of varying difficulty. These took me anywhere between 2-5 hours to complete so don't leave them to the last minute. Assessment wise, the class packs two midterms and a final. These exams are hard but fair. If you study enough and feel that you have a good grasp of the material, I promise you will be fine. Be careful of overstudying, though. The tests demanded a rigorous understanding of the more fundamental concepts while many of the advanced concepts were hardly touched on. Overall, I found the subject matter of this course fascinating, but its presentation sometimes fell short of my expectations."

One thing I really liked in the lectures was that he would occasionally mention something that wasn't exactly necessary for solving a problem, but it was indicative of a larger issue or provided helpful background (e.g. biographical information on famous mathematicians, examples of really large groups like the Monster, or stories of how a certain fact was useful in solving some historically significant problem).\nThere's weekly graded homework that must be either computer-printed or written one-sided in pen.  Needless to say, knowledge of LaTeX is helpful. :-)  He's really good about getting these returned every week.  (He only changed his routine of collecting and returning homework around Thanksgiving.)\nThere are two (non-cumulative) tests and a cumulative final which are hard but fair.  A helpful tip is to pay special attention to the topics or formulas he presents in class that aren't in the book, and he does expect you to know stuff in the book that isn't covered in class.  He uploads a \"practice test\" to Collab before each test; it's a great tool for review, but don't expect the style of questions on the real test to be the same as the practice test.  To illustrate, the practice test could have a bunch of \"prove ____\" type questions, while the test could have a bunch of \"state ___ theorem\" questions (or vice-versa).  As with the homework, he gets the tests returned amazingly fast (I think there was one test that he got back within 2 days).\nOverall, I highly recommend this professor (and course)."

His exams (two midterms and a final) include material that is NOT in the book but only mentioned during lecture. Therefore, you need to go and take notes, because only studying the book will not help you for the exams. Weekly problem sets come out of the book. The exams often reference obscure examples that are mentioned briefly in class. Study everything he says in lecture. I thought some of the examples he gave were not actually relevant only for them to later show up, even though he did not mention them during the review sessions.\nMiserable class. Hard only because the professor is a dreadful teacher, and the exams are tricky. Material itself is not that hard. Would not recommend, unless you have to take it."

He rarely if ever explained how to apply the theorems to do problems, which made the homework far more difficult than it had to be. That being said, the homework was by far the best preparation for the test as it was through the homework that you learned how to do applied problems as well as how to work out your own proofs. However, it took forever and was usually very hard. Going to office hours definitely helped but I usually couldn't make them because of timing conflicts. In addition to two midterms, a final, and homework, there were weekly quizzes. The true and false portions of these quizzes were pretty tricky and I usually did poorly, but it didn't affect my grade in the end. Overall, getting a good grade in the course was hard but doable. However, it required a lot of time on homework and making sure you understood the content despite the hard-to-follow book and lectures. In the end, I feel as if I learned a lot as far as how to write proofs, but I disliked every minute of it."

The nice thing is that quizzes are based on the homework assignment. Melcher posts homework questions for quizzes a few weeks in advance and the quizzes are usually very similar to the homework with a few extra problems thrown in. On quizzes, you get to use your homework - it's not checked. You can write down anything you want on your homework. You only get 45 minutes for each quiz and they're comprised of 10 True/False questions (if you get one wrong you lose 0.5 points, so be careful) and 3-4 more problems from the homework with extra parts added on. The quizzes aren't too difficult if you do the homework, but each question on the quiz is comprised of 3-5 parts.

The material is very challenging through and very time-consuming to thoroughly understand, but do-able if you like probability and work hard at it. Grading is fair and in your favor for the most part. The other comment sums up pretty well how the course is structured, 5 quizzes based on the HW problems assigned from the book where you can use your HW on the exams.  T/F questions can be tricky. Unlike other math courses, stochastic covers applications of mathematics meaning  it draws upon ideas from probability, linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations at times to solve specific problems instead of teaching a broad set of related skills.  You're basically using ideas covered in previous math classes and applying them to solve problems that arise in modeling random processes.  I would really really make sure you understand probability and linear algebra well before taking (calc + diff eq also help but aren't as important)."

Since the homeworks aren't turned in and the textbook doesn't have solutions, there's no way to actually invest time practicing and studying the material fully because you don't get anything graded back until after the quiz.  Notation in other textbooks is radically different so if you get stuck, it will genuinely take you hours to figure out the question that you have, if you ever figure it out.  In terms of quizzes, we had 45 minutes for a true/false portion plus 3 or 4 questions with 2-4 parts each.  All but one will be questions from the textbook, and the questions from the textbook will have at least one new part that you have to do on the spot.  True/false questions will mostly come from lecture so make sure you review your lecture notes and not just the textbook.  Professor Melcher is great though, super nice, super smart, approachable, just goes a little too fast sometimes.  She is vague with the curve (she mentions having 5 different methods), which is frustrating if you're trying to figure out if you're going to pass or not.  I'm not sure if I'd recommend Melcher or Saenz; there are flaws in both classes.  You'll probably learn more in Professor Melcher's class but you'll probably get a higher grade in Professor Saenz's class.  We don't go over any applications in this class at all so if you're a CS major or Engineer this is honestly not that useful of a class for you, except for maybe the first section on Markov Chains.  All in all, this class was pretty bimodal in that you will either do very well or you will struggle, and I definitely leaned more towards the latter so my review is biased in that sense; but, I wanted people thinking about taking this class to hear the opinion of someone like me."

The entire course was dedicated to Markov Chains, with the first half of the course discussing discrete time-discrete state space Markov Chains and the latter half introducing infinite state spaces and continuous time. I highly recommend this course to students interested in statistics and probability, as well as mathematical economics. Our grade consisted of 6 mini-exams, the lowest grade of which was dropped. One of the mini-exams was a computer exam, for which students had to write a program simulating a Markov Chain in Mathematica (but no previous programming experience was necessary). The mini-exams varied in difficulty considerably, although each student's final course grade is largely dependent on their scores relative to the overall class distribution; gauging your grade before the course ends can therefore be challenging – an uncertainty that's never fun.\nIn terms of teaching style, Gromoll is an engaging lecturer who provides extremely intuitive explanations (that complement the explanations provided by the textbook). However, the first half of the course was structured far more effectively than the second half; some of the later lectures became a bit chaotic and students were sometimes confused as to what content would be tested on the mini-exams. Overall, though, Gromoll is one of the best mathematics professors I have had, even though the course could have at times been conducted more effectively."

At the end of the semester, Axel did start to write solutions for the homework, but is was kind of too little too late. The midterm wasn't bad but the final was brutal. That being said, Axel gives the most effort points of any professor I've seen. If you put anything for a problem you'll get 60%-70% on it, and if you put something even resembling the write answer, you'll get full credit.\nPros:Axel is a great, interactive, and approachable  professor. This was his first semester teaching so there were some speed bumps, but I think as he gets his bearings, he will be excellent.The material is pretty interesting. If you have a remote interest in probability that this class will be pretty cool.Grading is pretty lenient.\nCons:Axel seems pretty in demand in the math world so there were three occasions where he left for conferences and we had subs. It was a little weird having so many teaching styles.Homework can be challenging and there aren't any book solutionsMaterial can get pretty dense.\nIn summary, if your prob/stat, you gotta take it but I'd take it with Axel and then you won't have to worry too much. Otherwise, it's still a decent math elective."

            "text": "Really solid class, Gromoll is great at explaining concepts in math finance. He's a probabilist and has never had experience in the trading/finance. From day 1, he makes it clear that the class would not be a finance class. The first 3-4 weeks of the course covers review of stochastic processes/sigma algebras/conditional expectation. So you don't actually start learning math finance until the first month. Then three exams are crammed in the last few months.\nThe first exam covers the binomial model on European contingent claims. The second covers American contingent claims, and the final is on the finite market model. In terms of difficulty, the second exam was far more difficult than the first (and had an average in the mid-50s). Gromoll doesn't use hard cutoffs in the class and rather your grade is based on how you did relative to the class. For example on the second exam the highest score was 45/50, and if you got over 80% you were in the top 10-15% of the class. For the third exam the material was crammed into the last few weeks of the class so I don't anticipate the 3rd exam average will be very high.\nThe class grade is completely determined by your performance on the three exams, so do your best not to tank any of the exams. The exams are almost exactly the same as the homeworks and proofs that were done in class or the textbook. The problem is that some of the concepts are a bit arcane to people especially if they're new to the topic so a lot of people don't do well.\nOverall the class is incredibly interesting whether or not you're interested in finance. If you're not, you get to learn a bit of graduate-level math. Again, the class is pretty rigorous when it comes to the level of math taught. If you're interested in finance it's also very useful since you get to learn about a discrete-time version of Black-Scholes. Binomial/CRR/FMM aren't incredibly useful in the industry but they're still a solid base to have if you're planning on joining the finance train later."

The class was super interesting to me  (think of it as 'How to use computers to do math'),  but the class was also somewhat frustrating to me due to organizational issues. Homeworks were a mix of proofs and coding (implementing various algorithms we were taught in class to solve problems like solving systems of equations or estimating derivatives), and he would release code templates to standardize the output of our submissions - the issue is that he would often not release them until the day before an assignment was due, resulting in a lot of last minute stress. Additionally, he was not a very fast grader - with a month left in the semester, and having submitted 4 homeworks and a midterm, I had received only 1 grade back. This was difficult because it meant I had no feedback on how well I understood the material, or if I needed to get help on anything. Granted, this was during the corona-virus period so it is understandable that there was a lot of transition and I'm sure he was more busy than usual (I know he had children at home that he was now helping to care for), so I would not necessarily say this is typical or to be expected, simply my experience with it."

Hayes is a nice guy and he is incredibly smart, but he should improve his teaching. He is too fast in proofs and most of the class barely follow him. The first in-class midterm is like a disaster, half of the class failing if without the curve. Takehome final seems to save your life, but a lot of material is based on lectures in the last two weeks, in which he rushes a lot and does not assign any homework about it. One good thing is that he curves generously and has \"get some midterm points back\" policy to save your life. Anyway, get ready to spend much time on it and you will feel proud of yourself if you survive."

She paces the assignments and exams so that students are not overwhelmed, and she is frequently available in office hours and after class. In addition, she is a clear and organized lecturer, so the course material is completely understandable and approachable. The homework assignments were a little long at times, but the exercises were mostly engaging extensions of the in-class material, not tedious verifications and calculations; as a result, I enjoyed completing most of the assignments. Some of them were reasonably difficult, but Valia offered helpful advice, so they never felt too overwhelming. The homework assignments also included optional exercises that touched on additional material, which was a nice addition. The exams were pretty similar to the homework assignments in terms of difficulty, but Valia gave us a full day to complete them (in my opinion, this take-home format works very well for high-level math classes).\nFor those who know something about linear algebra, we covered the following topics: vector spaces and subspaces; span, linear independence, and bases; linear transformations and matrices; determinants; eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalization; invariant subspaces and the Cayley-Hamilton theorem; and Jordan canonical form. We did not, however, discuss inner product spaces. We also touched on direct sums and quotient spaces, although the latter came only from optional homework exercises, so quotient spaces never appeared on exams. The textbook for the course was Friedberg's \"Linear Algebra,\" which is extremely readable and comprehensive, although a tad bit dry at times.\nI highly recommend taking this course with Valia if you have the chance. If you have engaged and supportive classmates (and an active GroupMe chat), the experience is wonderful across the board."

I felt myself become a better mathematical thinker through doing the homework assignments. Our class also had a very strong group chat that powered through tougher homework problems together.\nThe exams were long, but of the same format as the homework assignments. They were difficult, but not unreasonably so, and we had 24 hours to complete them.\nOverall, this course challenged my ability to think mathematically and helped me develop a great deal of confidence for pursuing future math courses.

There are weekly quizzes and homeworks due Mondays and Fridays respectively, each taking significant time, so be available. Tests are also take-home and you're given around four days to complete each. Make what you will of the all-take-home policy. Office hours are after class Thursdays so that's fairly accessible, and Rapinchuk checks email frequently. He's gruff at first but cares about student comprehension (if not necessarily grades). Take this class is you have a deep interest in linear algebra or advanced mathematical theory. It will be largely fourth-year grad student hopefuls."

It's also a TON of work, I typically spent ~8 hours/week on the homework and probably averaged somewhere around 70%. Professor Abramenko communicates the concepts pretty well, but he can be hard to interact with sometimes and he's not the most engaging.\nThe homework could get doubly frustrating at times because I would spend hours trying to solve each HW problem and not actually solve any of them, going home at 1am feeling defeated. It's also tough because only 3 of the 7 problems each week is graded, so sometimes your grade does not accurately reflect how well you did (can be in your favor or against you, so it generally works out in the end, but still quite frustrating).\nHeads up, you NEED to attend lectures since that's the only way you can get the material (he will sometimes reference numberings from class in the HW writeups and assume you have it written down), and you need to turn in HW in person."

Some topics are repeated but at a much higher and more abstract level.  Would not recommend taking this course without taking Survey of Algebra first, although I think a few students did so this semester.  Exams are ~65% fill in the blank and T/F with about ~35% of the points on proof problems.  Wang is a solid professor, really knows what he is talking about and open to questions.  The textbook wasn't great, it's meant for graduate students and wasn't much of a help if you didn't understand the lecture.  Overall a very challenging course, but an interesting one for those who enjoyed Survey of Algebra."

This class was super small, so he knew everyone's names and had a good sense of who was struggling and who was doing well. It's mostly students who are graduating, so he's not out to get you or anything. He is very enthusiastic and loves math, but sometimes can be a little bit long-winded in his explanations. I think the subject material is kind of difficult to be honest, but he is pretty lenient in grading. It relies a lot on linear algebra, so make sure to review that and be comfortable with that."

He separates the course to give you a taste of affine geometry, projective geometry and hyperbolic geometry. There are weekly homework sets that he reviews in class before you have to turn them in (15% of final course grade), two midterm exams (25% each of final course grade) and a final exam (35% of final course grade).  Overall, a low stress, upper-level math class that is honestly enjoyable. It is a small class, so get to know your classmates/get together to do homework. It makes the the material even easier to understand!"

Starting with Euclidean, the framework introduced is used throughout the semester.Then we studied Affine and Projective through lectures, and either Hyperbolic or Spherical via a final project. By far the most interesting course I've taken, but if proofs are not your strong suit this will be difficult. As an upper level course, proofs are the focus, every theorem in a lecture is proven so ensure you grasp the process (you don't need to memorize all the details though). The fundamental language of the course is linear algebra, so ensure you are strong in that area. Weekly problem sets are on average moderate in difficulty if you understand the material, but if there are gaps in your understanding it is exponentially more difficult. There were two take home midterms and one final project, and as long as you're good in the homework you're chilling for the midterms. However, writing up the final project was a long process and its dates overlap with preparation for the second midterm so the last 2 weeks were intense. Filippo is passionate and knows the material as well as the back of his hand, and is also a pretty generous grader. Interesting course on a beautiful subject."

We had a small lecture size of only around 10-14 students, which made it a cozy environment to ask questions and get good answers from Walker. He is fairly knowledgeable when it comes to many things beyond the material of the course, including the history of mathematics. The homeworks were appropriately open-ended and challenging for a graduate-level mathematics course and Walker is capable of providing great help during office hours, should you need it. My only gripe with this course was the final project. In groups, we wrote a short mathematical paper on a particular geometry (i.e. spherical, hyperbolic, etc). My group was a little difficult to work with, and although my section was thorough, well-explained, and free of errors, I had to take a C on the project as a result of errors from other students. Walker, like most professors at this University, has an idealistic view of project group dynamics and, consequently, grades strictly uniformly regardless of circumstances."

I could've sworn I was seeing things during the final exam, not to mention during the many late nights spent rapidly finishing homework.  This course was a semester of constantly worrying about my grade, since my homework average was 10+ points lower than I what I was used to getting in math classes, the expected average on the midterm was around a 60%, and Peter refused to curve anything until after the final.  The good news is that after all of the nightmares, you wake up and suddenly everyone has As and Bs in the class because, well, real analysis is hard and so what if your raw score is atrocious.\nPeter is, of course, a legend, though he can sometimes be a bit deliberately unhelpful when it comes to answering questions about homework problems and grades.  But the fact that he uploads typed lecture notes weekly is a godsend that allows for a bit of relaxation on the note-taking side.  And hey, it may be ridiculously difficult, but real analysis is still pretty cool, and this course is a prerequisite for a number of graduate courses, so there are definitely good reasons to take it.  Find friends in this class to help you with the homework and to enjoy a little commiseration with.\n#tCFS24"

The topic has so much depth and would be interesting to learn, but Groves makes the class almost unbearable to sit through. He gives off a bit of pretentious vibe with the amount he talks about his own sustainability. When my friends and I went to his office hours to get feedback on our essay topics, he said a lot of things but none were helpful. He also assigns about 7-10 reading, videos, and podcasts to watch every week. This wouldn't be so bad if the videos and podcasts weren't an hour-long each most of the time. They're used for the weekly homework quiz but aren't used for much else. Besides the homework quizzes, Groves doesn't assign that much stuff so time-wise the class is manageable. Groves is the type to take off a point or two here just so you don't get a 100, but if you put the work in an A- is pretty attainable. Still, I highly recommend not taking this class. #tCFfall2021"

In this class we had weekly readings that consisted of multiple hour long podcasts, videos, and many many many articles. He would give us assignments and take off points for things he didn't even ask for. We had a final paper and a final exam, and the material is just straight memorization of a bunch of useless information that is neither about sustainability nor energy systems. This class made me hate sustainability when I was previously excited to learn about it. He also often brags about his resume and drones on and on about how the city of charlottesville is not as good as him."

He is also useless in office hours, lectures, and providing any meaningful feedback on assignments. Lecture mostly consists of him reading off his slides word for word in a monotonous, droning voice.  At one point in the class attendance got so bad that he threatened to take points off for lack of attendance because 2/3rds of the class stopped showing up to his lecture and even that didn't make people come back. As far as grading and feedback goes, he doesn't provide a rubric and is very unclear on what he grades on. Most of his feedback to my assignments was just whataboutism. As for the homework, he puts very little effort into organizing his assignments and quizzes. While the material has the potential to be very interesting, the projects, readings, and lectures are some of the most boring I've ever had to sit through. The bulk of the course is reading quizzes, which are 5 questions pertaining to 10 or so readings that are all multiple pages long, or 20-30 minute long videos/podcasts every week. Finally, there are mandatory weekly discussion boards that aren't thought provoking at all, and a final that feels more like random trivia questions rather than testing our understanding of the material."

Your grade consists of weekly reading quizzes (open note), participation (posting on discussion boards/speaking up in class), a mid-semester assignment, and a final and essay at the end of the semester. The reading for the class is extensive but not hard, probably takes about 2-4 hours per week to get through it all. Most of it is podcasts/articles that are actually almost always interesting enough to easily pay attention, and the quiz questions will come straight from guiding questions Prof Groves provides for each assigned material. The mid-semester assignment wasn't too bad, nor was posting on the discussion board every week because it's almost always just asking your opinion on something you talked about in class. The final essay also isn't that hard, especially since you get to pick your topic. The final exam is pretty brutal though. He does give a 20 page doc about everything you should know, but it really doesn't narrow it down much. Be prepared to memorize a TON of random facts and vocab words because he will ask you specifics. Overall was not easy but I learned a TON, so if you're interested in sustainable energy and willing to put in the effort to do the readings and understand the material I'd definitely recommend this class."

If you’re intrigued by questions about how to improve our energy systems like electricity sector, transportation etc and how we should act during the course of transformation, this course gives a holistic review of how everything should look like and YES, it can be dry sometimes, but I don’t think this course deserves the critics it receives given all the necessary engineering details involved for us to understand the subject matter.\nDuring this semester, Prof. Groves showed his commitment for making the local community more sustainable, including a case where Charlottesville city council failed to consider the implications of Climate Change involved in housing. He also talked about ways for us to transition to greener living styles and I learned a lot personally as to how to contribute to Sustainability business with the personal energy audit(10% grade).\nOne thing to improve is that there are weekly quizzes, and questions CAN be trivial! (20% grade). But if you do your readings, put efforts into your final project(25% grade), you can EASILY do well in this class and learn a ton!\nOverall, I think the course is for people who care about Climate Change and sustainable energy designs that can make our communities better, and who are willing to put time into the materials he assigns, which can honestly be a lot. Prof. Groves is a nice guy and don’t hesitate to reach out to him."

If you need this course to fulfill your STS 2000 requirement, do not take it, because there are so many other courses that fulfill the requirement and are way more engaging.\nThe professor assigns reading homework assignments for every class period which come in the form of videos and hour and a half podcasts. It's mostly busywork, though, so as long as you dedicate a solid 1.5-2 hours per homework assignment, you can get it done. There are also weekly reading quizzes on the homework assignments from the previous week, so make sure you answer all of the questions. It looks like a lot, but I would type them up in a google doc to keep them organized, and did fine on the quizzes.\nThere are long-term assignments such as a Personal Energy Audit and a 2000-word final paper. I personally thought the Audit was interesting, but it was time-consuming. I divided it up and did portions of it each day, so it wasn't super stressful for me.\nIn all honesty, I stopped going to class in the first week and just did the homework assignments, blog posts, and his final study guide because most of the information presented in class was in the homework, and I ended up getting an A.\nThis course is doable, but you really have to put in a lot of work. After taking this class I would say my passion for sustainability decreased, unfortunately. I wouldn't recommend this class."

            "text": "I think most people who take this course expect it to be easy as most STS courses are considered to be easy. While I would consider the difficulty of the material as pretty easy, expect to do a good amount of work every week. You will have 12-20 weekly assigned materials like podcasts, articles, publications, videos, etc. The professor will then give out a 8 minute online quiz that tests your knowledge for these assigned materials. These quizzes will only have like 5 questions, but you will only know the answer for them if you have thoroughly gone through the assigned materials, which takes me roughly 8 hours. Fortunately, he provides a list of questions from each assigned material and picks 5 questions in there to be on the quizzes, so you know what to know for the quizzes. There are also weekly discussion boards, but these are pretty quick and easy. Occasionally, there are some writings or projects due, but they aren't too difficult and one of them I personally enjoyed. However, the ending of the class is very intensive. You will have a long paper to write and the final contains information about everything you've covered in the class. While a good portion of the material in the class is pretty cool, there is just a lot of information which can fry your brain a bit. I think he's a pretty good professor overall, though, and always extends help if needed. I also liked how he started memorizing all the names of the people in class who regularly spoke during discussions. Overall, if you're looking for an STS class, this is not a bad option, just be prepared to do at least 8 hours of work a week."

As someone who isn't really interested in many classes outside of engineering, and someone who very much felt that STS1500 was a waste of time, I enjoyed this class more than expected. Some of the moral and ethical theories were interesting and provide a unique way to approach ethical challenges. As an instructor, I believe Professor Davis is still newer to the department, but it seems he has made it easier to get a good grade in the class (wherein before it was either B or A he introduced ways to get B+ and A-). As a professor Davis is extremely welcoming and encourages diverse opinions in discussion or debate. Additionally, I found that if you do all the assignments it is not difficult to get an A."

The most interesting parts of it are when real-life engineering ethical scenarios arise, and we are able to have discussions about the course content and its applications to real life. However, most of the course content is just terminology and applications of different ethical schools of thought. Professor Pappas, while he can be a bit of an eccentric rambler, is extremely kind and flexible when it comes to course assignments and deadlines. He gives many opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester, and depending on your final grade the final exam can become optional. In terms of the course assignments, there are twice-weekly discussion posts and multiple writing assignments throughout the semester. There are also multiple group presentation projects throughout the semester. Overall, the course can be enjoyable if you make the most of it.\n#tCFF24"

STS 2600 is a very project-oriented, teamwork, and thoughtful, reflection-heavy course that will require significantly more hours to work on as compared to other courses. Overall, the course content was unfortunately pretty unmemorable; however, the soft skills you develop throughout the class are extremely beneficial to future professional endeavors. Also, the case studies offer great chances for deeper dives into how engineers play a significant role in project responsibility and safety.\nAs for the professor, while the professor was very nice and engaging, he is also A) a bit of a rambler and B) a rather harsh grader. DO NOT EXPECT TO GET a 100 on any major assignment - that's not his philosophy. His idea of ethics, as a course, is that nobody can ever be perfect in ethics, and it is a continuous growth process. However, this philosophy may have some of you panicking about your grade early on and in the middle of the semester. He offers bonus points and allows you to skip the final (for the lowest points he can offer on the final); little caveat to this, though, you really can't skip the final if you want an A without those bonus points, so take the max amount of opportunities if you want a chance of skipping with an A.\nThe hardest assignments were typically the presentations, not because of the content, but rather trying to figure out how harshly he is grading parts of his rubric, as well as how your group dynamic is. Overall, this class is not impossible, but do not go into it thinking you will get an easy A. It may be an A, but you will fight tooth and nail for it, and either sprint or trudge through psychological and sociological aspects that, quite frankly, most engineers don't understand very well.\n#tCFfall25"

She really loves the content she teaches, and truly believes in being accommodating and flexible with students. Her class felt like a break from all my other ones, but I still felt like I learned a lot. She does a lot of group work and discussions, and the course is kind of based on what topics the students want to learn more about which is really cool. There's some reading but nothing long, and the grading system is not the typical one. She does a \"fail, pass, high pass\" system where you have to get a certain number of \"high passes\" to get an A. A big part of her class is attending extra credit guest speaker presentations, and there were some AMAZING ones this year. Her class is really one where you get out of it what you put into it. It was such a great class!"

It makes no sense, yes shes lenient but i feel you shouldnt judge based on HIGH PASS, PASS AND FAIL. and the thing that didnt make sense is that if you failed you can retake and get a pass.. but if you get a pass.. you cant retake and get a high pass.

My one recommendation is do not forget to go to the extra credit talks early on in the semester so you do not have to cram for the class. It makes your life easier if you take all the assignments very seriously and get good grades, so you do not have to make up for poorly done work later on in the semester.

In all honesty I think it's about average for an STS elective, but it's all paper writing and groupwork, something that most engineers (like myself) do not usually enjoy. The grading is pretty hard too. I took the class for Credit/No Credit, but I think I put in quite a bit of effort and ended up around C+ level.

It isn't hard in the way that you don't have to study for it-- you just write the papers and then the weekly quizzes are just questions about the same topic you just wrote about. I don't think I really learned anything from this class though which just made it seem like a drag and Professor Louis's voice was just so monotonous and quiet. I had to go first for the group projects and my group didn't get a great grade, but after we presented Professor Louis provided more instructions for everyone else presenting for the semester. Our topic we were given was also something so specific we basically couldn't find anything on it (a very specific incident with water pollution) vs. other groups got subjects like Diversity in STEM and 5G Networks. It was pretty unfair because other groups were also given extra materials to use to help lead their research on their topics while we were given none. Also, the weekly quizzes ended up being outside of class and about an hour and a half per quiz which was kind of ridiculous. You would have to write an essay on Monday/Tuesday, then on Wednesday you have ~24 hours between when class ends to the next day to take the 1.5 hour quiz which you actually need all the time for. The quiz is also all made up of essay questions that might even have you research a specific topic. A lot of the information you can pull from his slides, but his slides are also not very descriptive so they are hard to review and a lot of the concepts he talks about you can't even find online which is frustrating if he won't further describe them in his slides.\nOverall, not a hard class, but if you have the option to take another STS, take a different one. This one isn't interesting, it is time consuming, and the grades fell at around a B+ for most people."

As for the class, if you already have background knowledge in public policy you should do well as long as you can write well too. I cannot stress this enough that this is a class where most of your grade depends on writing (on quizzes, biweekly papers, or final report). I thought the grading was a little inconsistent between the different graders but that could just be my luck. Also a major part of your grade is group-work, so make sure you know people (at least one other person) in the class who will put in the same amount of work as you will or you will suffer.TLDR:* lectures are pretty common sense if you have any background in public policy* group work is a major part of your grade* writing is a major part of your grade* take this for your sts2xxx series credit if you are up for the challenge"

No written homework, you just read 2 short articles before each class and then talk about them as a group.

If you're present and paying attention in class, he will like you and your grade will work itself out. Couldn't recommend this professor any more!"

Peter Norton is also a very particular professor who likes things to be a certain way. He insists your writing uses very concise, short sentences - and if you don't write this way he will take off points. His grading is quite subjective but there aren't many assignments so it doesn't matter too much. If you are on your phone or laptop and not making eye contact with him when he's speaking he will stop and ask you to pay attention. If you try to eat in his class he will ask you to stop. If you use the bathroom or get water during the class he will announce to everyone that you shouldn't leave during class. If you fall asleep in class he will ask the person next to you to wake you up. I found the content of his class very interesting but I have never had a professor that insisted that every student give him 100% of your attention every minute of the class. Despite his peculiarities, I still would probably choose to take the class with him if I had a choice."

The class is mostly spent on group discussions of different articles related to various STS topics (You decide as a group which articles each person reads and switch groups 3-4 times during the semester) and learning about how to write a strong (thesis) proposal (I found this extremely useful even after graduating). The other main assignments in the class include a casebook group project, where you study an STS phenomenon or event and write a wiki page and give one or two presentations on it, as well as the thesis proposal document. Pretty easy A/A+ as long as you spread your workload over the semester. Prof. Norton is extremely passionate about teaching the class and dedicated to each student's projects and success. Highly recommend!"

Besides the prospectus you have 2 other homework assignments throughout the semester, one of which is a little infographic and the other is a group presentation that is not nearly as stressful as it was made out to be (it was very low stakes). He also offers extra credit opportunities through the semester. He usually teaches a one time a week, 2.5 hr class but the class rarely lasted the entire time (I think it only happened once). The rest of the time you get out of class after about a hour or so."

She's an english professor by training and graded all the papers as such - got almost not feedback about content - everything about sentences mechanics and grammar etc. She makes you do a grammar workbook in class everyday too. The way she \"teaches\" STS is by having you read articles and write about them in extremely weird essays. She also has this weird grading mark-up language that requires a \"key\" to decipher when you get papers back which was a pain to deal with.   Talked about maybe two STS frameworks, while other classes got through a lot more and seemed better prepared for their STS research papers. She's a wonderful woman and super well read and has wonderful stories she uses to derail class with (as the previous comment mentioned) and even apparently invites student to her house for dinner but still. Overall a worthwhile class if you like writing and reading about the liberal arts and the like and want to improve in that realm, but not my cup of tee. Look elsewhere if you want legit training in STS and to be better prepared for your STS research paper."

Class times are engaging, the reading is not overwhelming, and she provides good feedback for writing.  She is easily approachable, genuinely wanting to get to know her students.  Classes are largely discussion-based and fun.  Overall, 11/10 recommendation!"

For each class period (2x a week), we were assigned readings of 20 to 30 pages that were largely encouraged but not required to understand the topic. In class, they expounded on the topic from the reading and held an open discussion, which students were welcome to contribute. The topics varied from how STS research is conducted, how Elon Musk's restructuring of Twitter impacted the company culture, how scientific texts describe sperm and egg in gendered terms, and the stories of Susan Fowler, Joy Buolamwini, and Ed Pierson. Their lecture topics included STS concepts like technosolutionism, SCOT, maintenance vs innovation, infastructure, and actor-network theory, which they were very knowledgeable about. Online quizzes after each class were simple, reflecting on what was taught or following a specific question that they asked. They also had assignments that helped us develop and build upon our prospectus topics, with occassional lectures dedicated to working on our writings and inviting the STS librarian to share thesis resources. They were very accomodating with late work and were always available to talk to regarding assignments or life. 100% would recommend them as a teacher, and will be taking their 4600 course in the spring."

He assigns a lot of readings to prep for class, but the pre-class assignments aren't horrible or anything, they are just designed to get you thinking critically about the material.  Elliott's style of teaching really feels more like a whole class, open-ended discussion than it does a canned lecture. He invited a couple guest speakers to our class who ranged from pretty drab to very engaging. In the last couple weeks of class, you do a group presentation on some STS topic of your choice. The debate day was my favorite."

He really makes a point to reach out to students and make them feel appreciated as individuals, not just parts of the class. He often starts classes by asking individual students about themselves and their interests, complementing cool things they have going on, or checking in with them if he already knows them. He really makes an effort to build a relationship with each of his students so he can better accommodate their learning needs. He gives good and thorough criticism on assignments, always with tips to improve, and ultimately gives good grades if you show that you're putting in effort and engaging with the material. He's genuinely one of the most understanding and down to earth teachers I've had and I take every class with him that I get the chance to. He has an infectious enthusiasm and really tries to make the experience about learning and personal development rather than just ticking some boxes for a capstone. He's also very fair and understanding - I had a lot of health issues when I took his class and he put in a lot of effort to accommodate me reasonably and help me make a plan to get my work done.\nThe work for the class is pretty reasonable. Before every lecture, there's a reading to complete, then during lecture we usually had some sort of collaborative activity to facilitate discussions about the topic of the reading. He provides a lot of guidance on the capstone-related writing assignments. Outside of those assignments and the readings, the only other assignments are a hand full of discussion posts."

He's an unprofessional professor overall and I have to agree with the previous review that he likes to make unnecessarily comments to specific students. He requires attendance for each class, yet his class is the most useless one that I have taken so far at UVA. The whole point of STS 4500 is to write your prospectus. Foley assigns additional and useless work compared to other STS 4500 professors and has a grading scale of only A,B,C with no in between. The class time was the biggest waste of time learning about useless STS frameworks with useless worksheets that we  as engineers will never again use in the future. He comes across as arrogant and definitely is judgmental of his students. Can be harsh in grading and very subjective as in there is no defined rubric on how you will be graded so its basically up to his discretion. To me he went out of his way for some students compared to others based on favoritism. Will happily give you a failing grade on a discussion post or journal entry assignment so make sure you put the effort into each assignment if you do take his class. Do yourself a favor and take the required STS 4500 course with Laugelli, Seabrook, or Jacques instead of Foley. You will have less work to do and the professors will act in a proper professional manner with better less subjective grading."

So you end up doing more work early but have a high-quality prospectus done early that will be very useful in STS4600.\nAlso, he makes a bunch of unnecessary comments about random stuff but that's how he gets close to his students and I genuinely believe he tried to connect with every one of his 40 students when I took it with him.\nSummary: no bs grading, mandatory attendance, prepares well for STS4600, interesting lectures (unique discussions/group work everyday, no lecture slideshows), interesting and genuine professor (referral!)"

The final goal is writing a Prospectus, a ~2000 word research proposal for what you plan on writing your senior thesis about.

I think Foley did a great job with pacing the class and a lot of work that you do earlier can be copy and pasted into the prospectus and even other assignments. Usually, there is a reading to do before each class, which are long at the start of the semester, but get shorter. There are also reading quizzes every 2 weeks (on one reading at time) which are pretty hard, but aren't worth too much (they contribute to the participation score). Foley's grading can be a bit unpredictable, with assignments being graded basically on completion, while others are graded really tough but I ended up with pretty good grades. Overall, I would recommend Foley for anyone that likes to be a bit ahead on work or doesn't want to have to write the whole prospectus at the end of the semester with no guidance. #tCFF23"

I appreciate the format because I saw some of my other friends with different professors really struggle towards the end because they had coasted through the beginning.  I had a few gripes with the class though. He does require attendance (and he ends up being a little strict about it at the end in terms of your participation grade) and does not give you a lot of information when you miss class. He is also not an easy grader. He teaches two classes in the fall and one in the spring so you might get booted if too many people try to enroll and have to find a different professor.

Only at the end of the semester did I realize that I had been building my prospectus the entire time through the discussion posts and assignments he gave us. He provides real, honest, no bullshit feedback, which makes you a better writer, and not stressing out at the last minute to write the prospectus. He is bold, sassy, and witty. Some may find his demeanor to be \"offensive\" or \"isolating\", I completely disagree. I feel that he is the realest professor here, shows you the STS isn't bullshit or useless,  and begins to build confidence in yourself. He gets to know each of his students and shows them that he cares, especially at the end of the semester sharing a few words of wisdom with each and every one of you."

It is boring, and I have noticed some students consistently almost fall asleep in her class, despite going in there full of energy. Then there were the assignments. From what I have heard, she tacks on a lot of extra work to STS classes in comparison to other STS professors, and especially during fall recruiting season, it barely leaves any time to try to get a job in the real world. She will then take forever grading papers, give back minimalist and inconsistent feedback. She places a lot of emphasis on APA format however seems to not fully understand it herself. An example, when I turned in my first Prospectus draft, she marked some things as APA, most as not. Next submission, I don't touch those citations, and she then marks the ones that were previously correct as now incorrect. Then there are the journals. She will have you write journals and submit them all semester on mostly random topics (One was on cat litter, another on Prometheus), and then not grade them until the very end with no feedback, and combine it with other attendance grades so you have no idea why. Speaking of attendance, it is mandatory, classes are not recorded, and if you need to miss class, you need to let her know in advance and write a memo about why you're missing, with a max of 2 absences before you're penalized. Definitely the professor who would say \"Well you used your 2 absences, so if you go to your grandparent's funeral it will affect your participation grade.\" Final notes, this is turning into a rant, she will mock you if you say something that is not within her worldview of being right (not necessarily actually right). I have actually gotten off of a zoom call with her about my paper and cried because she made me feel like an idiot, despite my paper being good according to other people. Avoid her at all costs."

            "text": "STS in general — This is easily the worst class I've ever taken at UVA, bar none (I will update this review if STS 4600 turns out to be worse but I doubt it). Much of this is due to Professor Baritaud as an instructor, but I think more broadly that STS 4500 and 4600 are fundamentally just badly designed courses. The idea behind STS, in general, seems to be that the SEAS wants students to engage with non-engineering disciplines and connect them to engineering practice in a way that gives the student a better understanding of how to interact with the world in an ethical and informed way. However, because most of the professors I've seen so blatantly mistrust their student's ability to comprehend non-engineering concepts (or the professors are otherwise inept), the class ends up being milquetoast and boring beyond belief. No information that challenged any of my preconceived beliefs or enlightened me in any way was presented. This class is exactly what you would imagine if someone said \"waste of time sociology-lite class\". I genuinely believe every engineering student would have a more fruitful experience if they were allowed to choose a humanities class of their choice (similar to the CS Integrated Elective system for the college) to replace this credit. They could even keep the Prospectus and Thesis, just change the actual content. Anyways, with that aside...\nProfessor Baritaud — There were many days in which I was walking to Professor Baritaud's class and thought \"I would genuinely rather receive 40 lashes than sit through this class for another second.\" There were many lectures in which the entire 1 hour and 15 minutes were taken up by Professor Baritaud going over a single rubric for a single assignment. This was genuinely torturous in a way that is difficult to put into writing. Thankfully, the assignments were actually very easy in my opinion, especially considering Professor Baritaud did not grade half of them despite claiming she would. The only assignments that actually matter at all are those related to the Prospectus, and Professor Baritaud is particularly brutal about grading formatting mistakes and citation issues. She doesn't actually check any citations (I left a bogus one in just to check), she only skims for formatting broadly. Your Prospectus could be complete nonsense and there would likely be no issue as long as the formatting was perfect.\nOverall, you cannot avoid taking this course if you are an engineer at UVa (sadly), but please do yourself a favor by taking it with literally anyone else if you can."

That is how this class do.\nAlso, this class is filled with Communist propaganda.  It kind of feels like Ku's mission to dissolution us with Democracy and to convince us that an Authoritarian government can develop technology more efficiently.\nThey also added an extra 1 credit class to the course at 7:00 pm on Mondays, made attendance mandatory, and then proceded to give us no credit for it.  That was basically a giant \"FU, your time isn't valuable so we'll just make you either stick around grounds until 8 pm every Monday\" even though this was not advertised on SIS beforehand.\nAlso, their brilliant way of incorporating sociology with engineering is to basically force every group to do their prospectus based on Civil Engineering.  While this may work out great for Civil Engineers, everyone else is screwed because now your prospectus isn't about your capstone project, but it's actually just about some random Civil Engineering topic that you don't care about.  The only way to fix this is to change professors and good luck with that: it's either out of the frying pan and into the fire or impossible because of enrollment permissions.\nAlso, they are not very good communicators.

He never really grades anything on time, fails to organize folders and documents well on Collab, and really didn't even have a syllabus for the class. He is very ambiguous and unclear with what is required for each part of the thesis and ultimately just confuses the class, which results in last minute panicking. He gave me a poor grade on my prospectus, the main component of your grade for this class, and left barely any comments as to why. He is very smart and loves discussing current events, but i would strongly suggest picking another professor if you desire a more organized and cadenced thesis experience.\nP.S. I had him for both 4500 and 4600, my entire 4th-year thesis experience."

In general, the discussions are pretty interesting if you like talking about social and technological issues. Bernes is a pretty reasonable grader, and if you're not sure on something you can go and talk to her during OH and that'll usually give you an idea on what she thinks. Overall, not a lot of work besides the required STS papers and the two student-led discussions you and your group are responsible for."

            "text": "GENERAL INFO: This course ended up pretty much how I expected. We had a big, scary Prospectus due in early November which was very stressful (I took the class for a grade), and everything else was incredibly boring and, in my opinion, pointless. That said, I cannot really fault Professor Berne for that. There is little she can do to really make the course more interesting, especially since the course is in a sort of socratic seminar style. A normal week would consist of reading 30-40 pages from, most of the time, a very dry book (There were some exceptions -- The Alchemy of Us was a very fun and easy read), watching some sort of interesting movie/video (ranging from 30 minutes to full movie length), coming to class, listening to a 20-30 minute lecture learning about how to write a paper (stuff you should already know to be honest), taking a difficult reading quiz (more on these later), then spending the remaining 90 minutes just talking about the reading/film. The class just seems to drag on and on, especially when you get to the conversation portion. But, again, there really is just no way around it; I don't blame Professor Berne for that.\nPROFESSOR: Berne is very kind and willing to listen/help her students. No complaints there. She genuinely cares, which I very much appreciate. However, there are a few caveats to note, but these might not even be a big deal to you:- Disorganized at times: Berne is constantly updating the syllabus and emailing you a new one -- like literally every two weeks. She had some outdated information in places around the syllabus and assignment pages, but nothing major. There was also one week we had 60 pages of reading... only to be told right before the quiz that only 30 pages would be tested. Glad I wasted 2.5 hours of my life for nothing. Basically, just stay on your toes, because she is not afraid of making last second changes.- Berne seems to have a left-political lean, as evidenced by some of the films/readings we had to do. She's very fair during discussions in class, so it wasn't really a big deal to me, but keep that in mind if that is an issue for you.\nGRADING:30% Prospectus: This is exactly what it sounds like. This is your big project for the semester that you will have to do no matter who you take STS 4500 with. In it, you essentially write an introduction section for your technical project and your STS project. Ours was limited to 2000 words, which is only like 7-8 pages. So, it wasn't too bad, especially once your initial literature review is done. I would argue that the literature review we had due before the prospectus was more stressful since you are basically starting from zero. I probably spent around 40 hours on it over the course of 4 weeks; however, I know others who finished the whole thing in 20 hours of total work. Depends how throrough you are and how much you care about your grade.20% Literature Review: This is essentially the groundwork for the STS section of your prospectus. Much of this can be copy-pasted directly into the prospectus, so take this seriously. This was due 2 weeks before the prospectus for us. All you do is basically search for sources for your chosen STS topic, and write about what they did that is pertinant to your project.25% Reading Quizzes: I've mentioned these before, but it is exactly what they sound like. As I have already mentioned, take notes/highlight any important looking words/phrases in the readings, because you can bet you will get some sort of fill-in-the-blank question asking for a very specific word from a very specific line. If you do not make note of it while you are reading, you will not do well.15% Team-Lead Discussion Leadership: This is a minor project that you will have to do at some point in the semester. Essentially, you will work with a group of 4-5 students to lead class discussion on a given week's readings/film. It is typically very simple, in that you create a short powerpoint summarizing the main points, and generate a few thought-provoking discussion questions. That's it. Super simple and easy 15% of your grade.10% Participation: You fill out a participation self-assessment form at the end of the semester. Be honest with it, because she keeps track of attendance. But all in all, super simple stuff.\nOVERALL: This course is an annoyance due to the dry, unnecessary material. But it is certainly bearable, and having a solid instructor like Berne who does her best to make it interesting helps. It is also not necessarily the easiest A, but as long as you give a reasonable effort, it would be hard to score lower than a B or B+. I definitely would not recommend taking the course at all if you have the choice... oh who am I kidding... no one takes STS 4500 by choice lol. Since you probably have to take it anyway, I would say you could do worse than Berne. She's not perfect, but she is a solid option for taking 4500."

She would use buzzwords like 'IoT', 'smart cities', and 'machine learning' a lot without really explaining them in depth, and basically I got the idea that she had no idea what she was talking about in lecture. She graded harshly on assignments without giving students a rubric beforehand or even explaining the assignment in class at all.\nRandom things on collab would be due at the end of the week, without any mention of them at all in class. We also had a 'Global Classroom' that wasn't integrated well at all with the lecture. It was basically an STS group of 3 kids sending students in a chinese university a set of 3 questions per week, and they would respond with their answers on WeChat. The global classroom initiatives weren't really addressed during lecture, and felt like a side project that we never acknowledged outside of turning in a table of responses each week. Poorly structured and expectations on assignments were not communicated well to students. Do not recommend."

She clearly sympathizes with Communist ideals and teaches the class from that slant - uncool.  She is incapable of tolerating opposing viewpoints, which I at least think should be a prerequisite for teaching a college class - uncool.  She has made the fourth-year engineering prospectus into a group project - uncool.  She focuses the class on \"Smart Cities\" and claims to be an expert on \"Smart Cities\" even though she never defined what a \"Smart City\" is and can't describe what makes a city smart - uncool.  She has restricted the group projects and thus the prospectuses to focus on smart cities (read Sociology/Civil E) - This was my breaking point.  I am usually pretty tolerable of \"uncoolness\" in classes but you have to draw the line somewhere.  I feel like I could have gotten past all of this if I could just choose what to write my prospectus about, which I'm fairly sure is a freedom granted to all other sections of STS 4500.  Maybe she has been inspired by one too many Communist ideals.  So, to all you third years - ANYONE BUT KU (and Ferguson too because Ku metastasised into his sections as well)."

Professor Brown is an excellent instructor.  He made it very clear what he expected of students, yet was flexible enough to allow them a significant amount of freedom in the assignments they completed.  He did an excellent job of explaining what the overall goal of the Fourth-Year Thesis is and how the Prospectus fits into the larger picture.  By November, I had some friends in other sections who didn’t understand what they were expected to do for the Prospectus; I had no such issues since it was laid out very clearly from the second week of class.\nDiscussions were always engaging and interesting, and they made me jealous of liberal arts students who get to take many of their courses in this format.  The readings were generally interesting, but it was still possible to participate in discussion without doing the reading.  Giving students discussion questions before class allowed for a more informed and fluid discussion with few awkward silences.  One of my favorite aspects of the course was the variety of majors in the class.  Any aspect of engineering would prompt the input of students studying that field: Systems Engineers would step in to explain economics and market forces concepts, Aerospace Engineers would describe relevant aeronautical technologies, etc.  Discussions always ended by relating the day’s topics to the modern challenges of engineers and society, so I never had a moment of wondering, “Why am I in this course, what purpose is this serving?”  And lest things get too dull, Professor Brown would readily read off a set of the funnies to give busy minds a break."

For this class specifically, I found it to be easier and more interesting than STS4500, because ethics cases are more engaging. Kent isn't the most organized when it comes to lecturing, with most classes ending before he could establish any of the strong points that he wanted to make. Also, he didn't grade much of anything other than the prospectus/thesis until the end of the semester, which I disliked because I had no idea how I was doing in the course. His grading is also a bit arbitrary (example: \"you did a great job with this\" - grade: 9.2/10). He's really approachable after class and I would encourage you to do so. Overall, I'd recommend him as your STS professor."

Every week you have the same routine, do the readings, take the open note 3 question multiple choice quiz, and post a short discussion post. In addition to that, you work on your STS research paper throughout the semester (first draft is due right before spring break). The class is otherwise nothing to write home about. It isn't super exciting or super boring. The topics are kinda interesting but at the end of the day, it's an STS class. You kinda just want to get it done and Prof. Laugelli gets that, so he's to the point. I'd recommend taking the class with Prof. Laugelli! #tCFS24"

He has a wonderful way of presenting the significance of STS, and making you actually care about it rather than just learn about it. This section of STS with Rider is much more class discussion based, but this actually makes it a much more engaging space. I felt comfortable to share the thoughts and opinions I held on things, helping me to resonate and engage with the content more than any class in engineering I have ever taken before. Rider will always be straight forward with you, honest, and real. His feedback for grading helps you a lot and his demeanor motivates you to actually write a good thesis paper. He loves to tell stories and be so random, but he's funny, and entertaining. He makes some of the classes optional workshop days, but given the option, I would never skip his class, because every class was so different, and this class developed a feeling of motivation and excitement about society and engineering. (Honestly, my favorite professor at UVA)"

The ethics lectures are more interesting than the Thesis lectures. She had us submit our final Theses relatively early compared to other classes (late March, a week after Spring break), but it actually worked out really well. I didn't have to worry about the class or my thesis at all the last 7 weeks of classes, whereas many other students I know had there's due beginning of May. For the Ethics portion of the class, it was mostly focused on student-led discussions and presentations, which were a lot of fun and actually very interesting and intellectually stimulating."

Elliott definitely also likes to talk in the class discussions a lot more than he admits, but it takes some of the pressure off always needing something to say and I still always enjoyed the discussions."

We would have in class discussions every lecture talking about 4-5 chapters of whatever book we were on, led by a different group of 4-5 students each day. The research paper had reasonable deadlines, though we had pretty much zero guidance. Professor Jacques would send feedback for the paper via email, which he seemed to have issues with all semester (not sending you emails or missing emails that you sent him).\nIn short, Professor Jacques is the most disorganized professor I encounter at UVA but you discuss modern issues and read decent books instead of reading academic papers and discussing ancient STS frameworks. Definitely worth the trade off in my opinion, but YMMV.\nSidenote: Despite being disorganized, Professor Jacques is a really cool, nice dude with an interesting government background. He facilitated some high quality discussions and graded leniently. He was disorganized, but like I said, I'll take that over reading boring STS papers and talking about STS frameworks.\n#tCF2020"

In reality, she talks at you for hours during lecture, assigns writing assignments, takes weeks to grade those assignments, then returns them with sparse, unhelpful feedback. Often the only feedback given is surface level. On an average paper, her comments consist of two one-word annotations, one single sentence annotation, and a smattering of text highlighted with absolutely no explanation or comment. Gems of actual comments she wrote include \"?????\" and \"BAD,\" with no additional information or actionable feedback. Over the course of the semester I have received two comments on the actual content of my writing, both of which were unspecific and unhelpful. Her expectations are ridiculously high and her grading is inconsistent at best. It's a common occurrence for her to grade a draft and not have any comments, only to dock points for the same thing on the final version. Her lectures are tangential, uninspiring, and truly challenging to sit through. It does not feel like she has taught me anything I couldn't get from the textbook, and my writing has not benefited at all either. She frequently drops hints that she may bump grades (\"you can start with a D and get an A- by the end of the class, my math tends to get bad around then\"), but this just reinforces the feeling that she cares nothing about substance and grades based on her whims. She also frequently apologizes for not returning grades when she says she will, sometimes missing her own grading deadlines 3-5 times on a given assignment, and explains that she's busy, yet she is not understanding of the fact that we are busy as well. She expects to give us close to nothing, and for us, in return, to produce work that meets her unclear, inconsistent, arbitrary standards, without feedback of how to actually reach those standards. Her expectations differ greatly from other professors, so those who did not have her for STS 4500 are at a great disadvantage (though this is arguably a problem with the STS department in general). By far the worst, least helpful, least understanding, and most pretentious professor I have had during my time at UVA. Save yourself some confusion, frustration, anger, and tears by avoiding this class at all costs."

His deadlines are earlier than a lot of other professors for the incremental completions of the STS research paper, but that actually ends up being better in the long run so that your procrastination is spread out among 3 iterations, as opposed to all at the end.

The subject is \"Race and Engineering\".The format of the course is kind of a \"flipped classroom\": we're assigned readings and a film each week and we discuss in class while the professor takes a backseat. There were around 20 students so if you don't like discussion there isn't much place to hide. Also, it's one 2h30 block a week, which is a lot on Zoom.The course is still in its early stages, but the material is really interesting and really important. I greatly expanded my worldview and knowledge of systemic racism and its place in engineering."
