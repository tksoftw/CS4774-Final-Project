I didn't think I would like the subject of the class but he made it interesting. Also he is a TA and it was his first time teaching and he is better than some the professors that I've taken for politics classes. There aren't any tests but there are some papers.", "rDate": "2015-04-10 17:05:28 +0000 UTC", "rEasy": 3, "rClarity": 4, "rHelpful": 4, "rWouldTakeAgain": null}

Though he's a grad student, he demonstrates mastery beyond his years in the subject of Latin. The guy's brilliant, and I am so glad that I took his class; Latin would have sucked for me otherwise. Funny, helpful, knows his stuff, and is super fun to be in class with; highlight of all my classes.
